INTRODUCTION.

_To I.E. Rosenberg._


You are anxious to obtain some knowledge of the history of Constantia
Dudley. I am well acquainted with your motives, and allow that they
justify your curiosity. I am willing to the utmost of my power to comply
with your request, and will now dedicate what leisure I have to the
composition of her story.

My narrative will have little of that merit which flows from unity of
design. You are desirous of hearing an authentic and not a fictitious
tale. It will therefore be my duty to relate events in no artificial or
elaborate order, and without that harmonious congruity and luminous
amplification, which might justly be displayed in a tale flowing merely
from invention. It will be little more than a biographical sketch, in
which the facts are distributed and amplified, not as a poetical taste
would prescribe, but as the materials afforded me, sometimes abundant
and sometimes scanty, would permit.

Constantia, like all the beings made known to us, not by fancy, but
experience, has numerous defects. You will readily perceive that her
tale is told by her friend; but I hope you will not discover many or
glaring proofs of a disposition to extenuate her errors or falsify her
character.

Ormond will perhaps appear to you a contradictory or unintelligible
being. I pretend not to the infallibility of inspiration. He is not a
creature of fancy. It was not prudent to unfold _all_ the means by which
I gained a knowledge of his actions; but these means, though singularly
fortunate and accurate, could not be unerring and complete. I have shown
him to you as he appeared on different occasions, and at successive
periods to me. This is all that you will demand from a faithful
biographer.

If you were not deeply interested in the fate of my friend, yet my
undertaking will not be useless, inasmuch as it will introduce you to
scenes to which you have been hitherto a stranger. The modes of life,
the influence of public events upon the character and happiness of
individuals in America, are new to you. The distinctions of birth, and
the artificial degrees of esteem or contempt which connect themselves
with different professions and ranks in your native country, are but
little known among us. Society and manners constitute your favourite
study, and I am willing to believe that my relation will supply you with
knowledge, on these heads, not to be otherwise obtained. If these
details be in that respect unsatisfactory, all that I can add, is my
counsel to go and examine for yourself.

ORMOND,

OR THE

_SECRET WITNESS._




CHAPTER I.


Stephen Dudley was a native of New York. He was educated to the
profession of a painter. His father's trade was that of an apothecary.
But this son, manifesting an attachment to the pencil, he was resolved
that it should be gratified. For this end Stephen was sent at an early
age to Europe, and not only enjoyed the instructions of Fuzeli and
Bartolozzi, but spent a considerable period in Italy, in studying the
Augustan and Medicean monuments. It was intended that he should practise
his art in his native city, but the young man, though reconciled to
this scheme by deference to paternal authority, and by a sense of its
propriety, was willing as long as possible to postpone it. The
liberality of his father relieved him from all pecuniary cares. His
whole time was devoted to the improvement of his skill in his favourite
art, and the enriching of his mind with every valuable accomplishment.
He was endowed with a comprehensive genius and indefatigable industry.
His progress was proportionably rapid, and he passed his time without
much regard to futurity, being too well satisfied with the present to
anticipate a change. A change however was unavoidable, and he was
obliged at length to pay a reluctant obedience to his father's repeated
summons. The death of his wife had rendered his society still more
necessary to the old gentleman.

He married before his return. The woman whom he had selected was an
unportioned orphan, and was recommended merely by her moral qualities.
These, however, were eminent, and secured to her, till the end of her
life, the affection of her husband. Though painting was capable of fully
gratifying his taste as matter of amusement, he quickly found that, in
his new situation, it would not answer the ends of a profession. His
father supported himself by the profits of his shop, but with all his
industry he could do no more than procure a subsistence for himself and
his son.

Till his father's death young Dudley attached himself to painting. His
gains were slender, but he loved the art, and his father's profession
rendered his own exertions in a great degree superfluous. The death of
the elder Dudley introduced an important change in his situation. It
thenceforth became necessary to strike into some new path, to deny
himself the indulgence of his inclinations, and regulate his future
exertions by a view to nothing but gain. There was little room for
choice. His habits had disqualified him for mechanical employments. He
could not stoop to the imaginary indignity which attended them, nor
spare the time necessary to obtain the requisite degree of skill. His
father died in possession of some stock, and a sufficient portion of
credit to supply its annual decays. He lived at what they call a _good
stand_, and enjoyed a certain quantity of permanent custom. The
knowledge that was required was as easily obtained as the elements of
any other profession, and was not wholly unallied to the pursuits in
which he had sometimes engaged. Hence he could not hesitate long in
forming his resolution, but assumed the management of his father's
concerns with a cheerful and determined spirit.

The knowledge of his business was acquired in no long time; He was
stimulated to the acquisition by a sense of duty; he was inured to
habits of industry, and there were few things capable to resist a
strenuous exertion of his faculties. Knowledge of whatever kind afforded
a compensation to labour; but the task being finished, that which
remained, which in ordinary apprehensions would have been esteemed an
easy and smooth path, was to him insupportably disgustful. The drudgery
of a shop, where all the faculties were at a stand, and one day was an
unvaried repetition of the foregoing, was too incongenial to his
disposition not to be a source of discontent. This was an evil which it
was the tendency of time to increase rather than diminish. The longer he
endured it the less tolerable it became. He could not forbear comparing
his present situation with his former, and deriving from the contrast
perpetual food for melancholy.

The indulgence of his father had contributed to instil into him
prejudices, in consequence of which a certain species of disgrace was
annexed to every employment of which the only purpose was gain. His
present situation not only precluded all those pursuits which exalt and
harmonize the feelings, but was detested by him as something humiliating
and ignominious. His wife was of a pliant temper, and her condition less
influenced by this change than that of her husband. She was qualified to
be his comforter; but instead of dispelling his gloom by judicious
arguments, or a seasonable example of vivacity, she caught the infection
that preyed upon his mind, and augmented his anxieties by partaking in
them.

By enlarging in some degree the foundation on which his father had
built, he had provided the means of a future secession, and might
console himself with the prospect of enjoying his darling ease at some
period of his life. This period was necessarily too remote for his
wishes; and had not certain occurrences taken place, by which he was
flattered with the immediate possession of ease, it is far from being
certain that he would not have fallen a victim to his growing
disquietudes.

He was one morning engaged behind his counter as usual, when a youth
came into his shop, and, in terms that bespoke the union of fearlessness
and frankness, inquired whether he could be engaged as an apprentice. A
proposal of this kind could not be suddenly rejected or adopted. He
stood in need of assistance; the youth was manly and blooming, and
exhibited a modest and ingenuous aspect. It was possible that he was, in
every respect, qualified for the post for which he applied; but it was
previously necessary to ascertain these qualifications. For this end he
requested the youth to call at his house in the evening, when he should
be at leisure to converse with him, and furnished him with suitable
directions.

The youth came according to appointment. On being questioned as to his
birthplace and origin, he stated that he was a native of Wakefield, in
Yorkshire; that his family were honest, and his education not mean; that
he was the eldest, of many children, and having attained an age at which
he conceived it his duty to provide for himself, he had, with the
concurrence of his friends, come to America, in search of the means of
independent subsistence; that he had just arrived in a ship which he
named, and, his scanty stock of money being likely to be speedily
consumed, this had been the first effort he had made to procure
employment.

His tale was circumstantial and consistent, and his veracity appeared
liable to no doubt. He was master of his book and his pen, and had
acquired more than the rudiments of Latin. Mr. Dudley did not require
much time to deliberate. In a few days the youth was established as a
member of his family, and as a coadjutor in his shop, nothing but food,
clothing, and lodging being stipulated as the reward of his services.

The young man improved daily in the good opinion of his master. His
apprehension was quick, his sobriety invariable, and his application
incessant. Though by no means presumptuous or arrogant, he was not
wanting in a suitable degree of self-confidence. All his propensities
appeared to concentre in his occupation and the promotion of his
master's interest, from which he was drawn aside by no allurements of
sensual or intellectual pleasure. In a short time he was able to relieve
his master of most of the toils of his profession, and Mr. Dudley a
thousand times congratulated himself on possessing a servant equally
qualified by his talents and his probity. He gradually remitted his
attention to his own concerns, and placed more absolute reliance on the
fidelity of his dependant.

Young Craig, that was the name of the youth, maintained a punctual
correspondence with his family, and confided to his patron, not only
copies of all the letters which he himself wrote, but those which, from
time to time, he received. He had several correspondents, but the chief
of those were his mother and his eldest sister. The sentiments contained
in their letters breathed the most appropriate simplicity and,
tenderness, and flowed with the nicest propriety, from the different
relationships of mother and sister. The style, and even the penmanship,
were distinct and characteristical.

One of the first of these epistles was written by the mother to Mr.
Dudley, on being informed by her son of his present engagement. It was
dictated by that concern for the welfare of her child befitting the
maternal character. Gratitude, for the ready acceptance of the youth's
services, and for the benignity of his deportment towards him, a just
representation of which had been received by her from the boy himself,
was expressed with no inconsiderable elegance; as well as her earnest
wishes that Mr. Dudley should extend to him not only the indulgence, but
the moral superintendence of a parent.

To this Mr. Dudley conceived it incumbent upon him to return a
consenting answer, and letters were in this manner occasionally
interchanged between them.

Things remained in this situation for three years, during which period
every day enhanced the reputation of Craig, for stability and integrity.
A sort of provisional engagement had been made between the parents,
unattended however by any legal or formal act, that things should remain
on their present footing for three years. When this period terminated,
it seemed as if a new engagement had become necessary. Craig expressed
the utmost willingness to renew the former contract, but his master
began to think that the services of his pupil merited a higher
recompense. He ascribed the prosperity that had hitherto attended him to
the disinterested exertions of his apprentice. His social and literary
gratifications had been increased by the increase of his leisure. These
were capable of being still more enlarged. He had not yet acquired what
he deemed a sufficiency, and could not therefore wholly relieve himself
from the turmoils and humiliation of a professional life. He concluded
that he should at once consult his own interest, and perform no more
than an act of justice to a faithful servant, by making Craig his
partner, and allowing him a share of the profits, on condition of his
discharging all the duties of the trade.

When this scheme was proposed to Craig he professed unbounded gratitude,
considered all that he had done as amply rewarded by the pleasure of
performance, and as being nothing more than was prescribed by his duty.
He promised that this change in his situation should have no other
effect than to furnish new incitements to diligence and fidelity, in the
promotion of an interest, which would then become in a still higher
degree than formerly a common one. Mr. Dudley communicated his
intention to Craig's mother, who, in addition to many grateful
acknowledgments, stated that a kinsman of her son had enabled him, in
case of entering into partnership, to add a small sum to the common
stock, and that for this sum Craig was authorized to draw upon a London
banker. The proposed arrangement was speedily effected. Craig was
charged with the management of all affairs, and Mr. Dudley retired to
the enjoyment of still greater leisure. Two years elapsed, and nothing
occurred to interrupt the harmony that subsisted between the partners.
Mr. Dudley's condition might be esteemed prosperous. His wealth was
constantly accumulating. He had nearly attained all that he wished, and
his wishes still aimed at nothing less than splendid opulence. He had
annually increased the permanent sources of his revenue. His daughter
was the only survivor of many children who perished in their infancy,
before habit and maturity, had rendered the parental tie difficult to
break. This daughter had already exhibited proofs of a mind susceptible
of high improvement, and the loveliness of her person promised to keep
pace with her mental acquisitions. He charged himself with the care of
her education, and found no weariness or satiety in this task that might
not be amply relieved by the recreations of science and literature. He
flattered himself that his career, which had hitherto been exempt from
any considerable impediment, would terminate in tranquillity. Few men
might with more propriety have discarded all apprehensions respecting
futurity.

Craig had several sisters, and one brother younger than himself. Mr.
Dudley, desirous of promoting the happiness of this family, proposed to
send for this brother and have him educated to his own profession,
insinuating to his partner that at the time when the boy should have
gained sufficient stability and knowledge, he himself might be disposed
to relinquish the profession altogether, on terms particularly
advantageous to the two brothers, who might thenceforth conduct their
business jointly. Craig had been eloquent in praise of this lad, and his
testimony had, from time to time, been confirmed by that of his mother
and sister. He had often expressed his wishes for the prosperity of the
lad; and, when his mother had expressed her doubts as to the best method
of disposing of him, modestly requested Mr. Dudley's advice on this
head. The proposal, therefore, might be supposed to be particularly
acceptable, and yet Craig expressed reluctance to concur with it. This
reluctance was accompanied with certain tokens which sufficiently
showed whence it arose. Craig appeared unwilling to increase those
obligations under which he already laboured; his sense of gratitude was
too acute to allow him to heighten it by the reception of new benefits.

It might be imagined that this objection would be easily removed; but
the obstinacy of Craig's opposition was invincible. Mr. Dudley could not
relinquish a scheme to which no stronger objection could be made; and,
since his partner could not be prevailed upon to make this proposal to
the friends of the lad, he was determined to do it himself. He
maintained an intercourse by letters with several of those friends which
he formed in his youth. One of them usually resided in London. From him
he received about this time a letter, in which, among other information,
the writer mentioned his intention of setting out on a tour through
Yorkshire and the Scottish highlands. Mr. Dudley thought this a
suitable opportunity for executing his design in favour of young Craig.
He entertained no doubts about the worth and condition of this family,
but was still desirous of obtaining some information on this head from
one who would pass through the town where they resided, who would
examine with his own eyes, and on whose discernment and integrity he
could place an implicit reliance. He concealed this intention from his
partner, and entrusted his letter to a friend who was just embarking for
Europe. In due season he received an answer, confirming, in all
respects, Craig's representations, but informing him that the lad had
been lately disposed of in a way not equally advantageous with that
which Mr. Dudley had proposed, but such as would not admit of change.

If doubts could possibly be entertained respecting the character and
views of Craig, this evidence would have dispelled them. But plans,
however skilfully contrived, if founded on imposture, cannot fail of
being sometimes detected. Craig had occasion to be absent from the city
for some weeks. Meanwhile a letter had been left at his lodgings by one
who merely inquired if that were the dwelling of Mr. Dudley, and being
answered by the servant in the affirmative, left the letter without
further parley. It was superscribed with a name unknown to any of the
family, and in a hand which its badness rendered almost illegible. The
servant placed it in a situation to be seen by his master.

Mr. Dudley allowed it to remain unopened for a considerable time. At
length, deeming it excusable to discover by any means the person to whom
it was addressed, he ventured to unseal it. It was dated at Portsmouth
in New-Hampshire. The signature was Mary Mansfield. It was addressed to
her son, and was a curious specimen of illiterateness. Mary herself was
unable to write, as she reminds her son, and had therefore procured the
assistance of Mrs. Dewitt, for whose family she washed. The amanuensis
was but little superior in the art of penmanship to her principal. The
contents of the epistle were made out with some difficulty. This was the
substance of it:--

Mary reproaches her son for deserting her, and letting five years pass
away without allowing her to hear from him. She informed him of her
distresses as they flowed from sickness and poverty, and were aggravated
by the loss of her son who was so handsome and promising a lad. She
related her marriage with Zekel Hackney, who first brought her tidings
of her boy. He was master, it seems, of a fishing smack, and voyaged
sometimes to New York. In one of his visits, to this city he met a
mighty spry young man, in whom he thought he recognized his wife's son.
He had traced him to the house of Mr. Dudley, and on inquiry discovered
that the lad resided here. On his return he communicated the tidings to
his spouse, who had now written to reproach him for his neglect of his
poor old mother, and to entreat his assistance to relieve her from the
necessity of drudging for her livelihood.

This letter was capable of an obvious construction. It was, no doubt,
founded in mistake, though it was to be acknowledged that the mistake
was singular. Such was the conclusion immediately formed by Mr. Dudley.
He quietly replaced the letter on the mantel-piece, where it had before
stood, and dismissed the affair from his thoughts.

Next day Craig returned from his journey. Mr. Dudley was employed in
examining some papers in a desk that stood behind the door in the
apartment in which the letter was placed. There was no other person in
the room when Craig entered it. He did not perceive Mr. Dudley, who was
screened from observation by his silence and by an open door. As soon as
he entered, Mr. Dudley looked at him, and made no haste to speak. The
letter, whose superscription was turned towards him, immediately
attracted Craig's attention. He seized it with some degree of eagerness,
and observing the broken seal, thrust it hastily into his pocket,
muttering at the same time, in a tone betokening a mixture of
consternation and anger, "Damn it!"--He immediately left the room, still
uninformed of the presence of Mr. Dudley, who began to muse with some
earnestness on what he had seen. Soon after, he left this room, and went
into another in which the family usually sat. In about twenty minutes
Craig made his appearance with his usual freedom and plausibility.
Complimentary and customary topics were discussed. Mrs. Dudley and her
daughter were likewise present. The uneasiness which the incident just
mentioned had occasioned in the mind of Mr. Dudley was at first
dispelled by the disembarrassed behaviour of his partner, but new matter
of suspicion was speedily afforded him. He observed that his partner
spoke of his present entrance as of the first since his arrival, and
that when the lady mentioned that he had been the subject of a curious
mistake, a letter being directed to him by a strange name, and left
there during his absence, he pretended total ignorance of the
circumstance. The young lady was immediately directed by her mother to
bring the letter, which lay, she said, on the mantle-tree in the next
room.

During this scene Mr. Dudley was silent. He anticipated the
disappointment of the messenger, believing the letter to have been
removed. What then was his surprise when the messenger returned bearing
the letter in her hand! Craig examined and read it, and commented with
great mirth on the contents, acting all the while as if he had never
seen it before. These appearances were not qualified to quiet suspicion;
the more Dudley brooded over them the more dissatisfied he became. He
however concealed his thoughts, as well from Craig himself as his
family, impatiently waiting for some new occurrence to arise by which he
might square his future proceedings.

During Craig's absence Mrs. Dudley had thought this a proper occasion
for cleaning his apartment. The furniture, and among the rest, a large
chest strongly fastened, was removed into an adjoining room which was
otherwise unoccupied, and which was usually kept locked. When the
cleansing was finished, the furniture was replaced, except this trunk,
which its bulk, the indolence of the servant, and her opinion of its
uselessness, occasioned her to leave in the closet.

About a week after this, on a Saturday evening, Craig invited to sup
with him a friend who was to embark on the ensuing Monday for Jamaica.
During supper, at which the family were present, the discourse turned on
the voyage on which the guest was about to enter. In the course of talk
the stranger expressed how much he stood in need of a strong and
commodious chest, in which he might safely deposit his cloths and
papers. Not being apprized of the early departure of the vessel, he had
deferred till it was too late applying to an artizan.

Craig desired him to set himself at rest on that head, for that he had
in his possession just such a trunk as he described. It was of no use to
him, being long filled with nothing better than refuse and lumber, and
that, if he would, he might send for it the next morning. He turned to
Mrs. Dudley and observed, that the trunk to which he alluded was in her
possession, and he would thank her to direct its removal into his own
apartment, that he might empty it of its present contents, and prepare
it for the service of his friend. To this she readily assented.

There was nothing mysterious in this affair, but the mind of Mr. Dudley
was pained with doubts. He was now as prone to suspect as he was
formerly disposed to confidence. This evening he put the key of the
closet in his own pocket. When inquired for the next day, it was, of
course, missing. It could not be found on the most diligent search. The
occasion was not of such moment as to justify breaking the door. Mr.
Dudley imagined that he saw in Craig more uneasiness at this
disappointment than he was willing to express. There was no remedy. The
chest remained where it was, and next morning the ship departed on her
voyage.

Craig accompanied his friend on board, was prevailed upon to go to sea
with him, designing to return with the pilot-boat, but when the pilot
was preparing to leave the vessel, such was this man's complaisance to
the wishes of his friend, that he concluded to perform the remainder of
the voyage in his company. The consequences are easily seen. Craig had
gone with a resolution of never returning. The unhappy Dudley was left
to deplore the total ruin of his fortune, which had fallen a prey to
the arts of a subtle imposture.

The chest was opened, and the part which Craig had been playing for some
years, with so much success, was perfectly explained. It appeared that
the sum which Craig had contributed to the common stock, when first
admitted into partnership, had been previously purloined from the daily
receipts of his shop, of which an exact register was kept. Craig had
been so indiscreet as to preserve this accusing record, and it was
discovered in this depository. He was the son of Mary Mansfield, and a
native of Portsmouth. The history of the Wakefield family, specious and
complicated as it was, was entirely fictitious. The letters had been
forged, and the correspondence supported by his own dexterity. Here was
found the letter which Mr. Dudley had written to his friend requesting
him to make certain inquiries at Wakefield, and which he imagined that
he had delivered with his own hands to a trusty bearer. Here was the
original draught of the answer he received. The manner in which this
stratagem had been accomplished came gradually to light. The letter
which was written to the Yorkshire traveller had been purloined, and
another with a similar superscription, in which the hand of Dudley was
exactly imitated, and containing only brief and general remarks, had
been placed in its stead. Craig must have suspected its contents, and by
this suspicion have been incited to the theft. The answer which the
Englishman had really written, and which sufficiently corresponded with
the forged letter, had been intercepted by Craig, and furnished him a
model from which he might construct an answer adapted to his own
purposes.

This imposture had not been sustained for a trivial purpose. He had
embezzled a large share of the stock, and had employed the credit of the
house to procure extensive remittances to be made to an agent at a
distance, by whom the property was effectually secured. Craig had gone
to participate these spoils, while the whole estate of Mr. Dudley was
insufficient to pay the demands that were consequently made upon him.

It was his lot to fall into the grasp of men who squared their actions
by no other standard than law, and who esteemed every claim to be
incontestably just that could plead that sanction. They did not indeed
throw him into prison. When they had despoiled him of every remnant of
his property, they deemed themselves entitled to his gratitude for
leaving his person unmolested.




CHAPTER II.


Thus in a moment was this man thrown from the summit of affluence to the
lowest indigence. He had been habituated to independence and ease. This
reverse, therefore, was the harder to bear. His present situation was
much worse than at his father's death. Then he was sanguine with youth
and glowing with health. He possessed a fund on which he could commence
his operations. Materials were at hand, and nothing was wanted but skill
to use them. Now he had advanced in life. His frame was not exempt from
infirmity. He had so long reposed on the bosom of opulence, and enjoyed
the respect attendant on wealth, that he felt himself totally
incapacitated for a new station. His misfortune had not been foreseen.
It was embittered by the consciousness of his own imprudence, and by
recollecting that the serpent which had stung him was nurtured in his
own bosom.

It was not merely frugal fare and a humble dwelling to which he was
condemned. The evils to be dreaded were beggary and contempt. Luxury and
leisure were not merely denied him. He must bend all his efforts to
procure clothing and food, to preserve his family from nakedness and
famine. His spirit would not brook dependence. To live upon charity, or
to take advantage of the compassion of his friends, was a destiny far
worse than any other. To this therefore he would not consent. However
irksome and painful it might prove, he determined to procure hit bread
by the labour of his hands.

But to what scene or kind of employment should he betake himself? He
could not endure to exhibit this reverse of fortune on the same theatre
which had witnessed his prosperity. One of his first measures was to
remove from New York to Philadelphia. How should he employ himself in
his new abode? Painting, the art in which he was expert, would not
afford him the means of subsistence. Though no despicable musician, he
did not esteem himself qualified to be a teacher of this art. This
profession, besides, was treated by his new neighbours with general,
though unmerited contempt. There were few things on which he prided
himself more than on the facilities and elegances of his penmanship. He
was besides well acquainted with arithmetic and accounting. He concluded
therefore to offer his services, as a writer in a public office. This
employment demanded little bodily exertion. He had spent much of his
time at the book and the desk: his new occupation, therefore, was
further recommended by its resemblance to his ancient modes of life.

The first situation of this kind for which he applied he obtained. The
duties were constant, but not otherwise toilsome or arduous. The
emoluments were slender, but my contracting, within limits as narrow as
possible, his expenses, they could be made subservient to the mere
purposes of subsistence. He hired a small house in the suburbs of the
city. It consisted of a room above and below, and a kitchen. His wife,
daughter, and one girl, composed its inhabitants.

As long as his mind was occupied in projecting and executing these
arrangements, it was diverted from uneasy contemplations. When his life
became uniform, and day followed day in monotonous succession, and the
novelty of his employment had disappeared, his cheerfulness began
likewise to fade, and was succeeded by unconquerable melancholy. His
present condition was in every respect the contrast of his former. His
servitude was intolerable. He was associated with sordid hirelings,
gross and uneducated, who treated his age with rude familiarity, and
insulted his ears with ribaldry and scurrilous jests. He was subject to
command, and had his portion of daily drudgery allotted to him, to be
performed for a pittance no more than would buy the bread which he daily
consumed. The task assigned him was technical and formal. He was
perpetually encumbered with the rubbish of law, and waded with laborious
steps through its endless tautologies, its impertinent circuities, its
lying assertions, and hateful artifices. Nothing occurred to relieve or
diversify the scene. It was one tedious round of scrawling and jargon; a
tissue made up of the shreds and remnants of barbarous antiquity,
polluted with the rust of ages, and patched by the stupidity of modern
workmen into new deformity.

When the day's task was finished, jaded spirits, and a body enfeebled by
reluctant application, were but little adapted to domestic enjoyments.
These indeed were incompatible with a temper like his, to whom the
privation of the comforts that attended his former condition was
equivalent to the loss of life. These privations were still more painful
to his wife, and her death added one more calamity to those tinder which
he already groaned. He had always loved her with the tenderest
affection, and he justly regarded this evil as surpassing all his former
woes.

But his destiny seemed never weary of persecuting him. It was not enough
that he should fall a victim to the most atrocious arts, that he should
wear out his days in solitude and drudgery, that he should feel not only
the personal restraints and hardships attendant upon indigence, but the
keener pangs that result from negligence and contumely. He was
imperfectly recovered from the shock occasioned by the death of his
wife, when his sight was invaded by a cataract. Its progress was rapid,
and terminated in total blindness.

He was now disabled from pursuing his usual occupation. He was shot out
from the light of heaven, and debarred of every human comfort. Condemned
to eternal darkness, and worse than the helplessness of infancy, he was
dependant for the meanest offices on the kindness of others; and he who
had formerly abounded in the gifts of fortune, thought only of ending
his days in a gaol or an almshouse.

His situation however was alleviated by one circumstance. He had a
daughter whom I have formerly mentioned, as the only survivor of many
children. She was sixteen years of age when the storm of adversity fell
upon her father's house. It may be thought that one educated as she had
been, in the gratification of all her wishes, and at an age of timidity
and inexperience, would have been less fitted than her father for
encountering misfortune; and yet when the task of comforter fell upon
her her strength was not found wanting. Her fortitude was immediately
put to the test. This reverse did not only affect her obliquely, and
through the medium of her family, but directly, and in one way usually
very distressful to female feelings.

Her fortune and character had attracted many admirers. One of them had
some reason to flatter himself with success. Miss Dudley's notions had
little in common with those around her. She had learned to square her
conduct, in a considerable degree, not by the hasty impulses of
inclination, but by the dictates of truth. She yielded nothing to
caprice or passion. Not that she was perfectly exempt from intervals of
weakness, or from the necessity of painful struggles, but these
intervals were transient, and these struggles always successful. She was
no stranger to the pleadings of love from the lips of others, and in her
own bosom; but its tumults were brief, and speedily gave place to quiet
thoughts and steadfast purposes.

She had listened to the solicitations of one not unworthy in himself,
and amply recommended by the circumstances of family and fortune. He was
young, and therefore impetuous. Of the good that he sought, he was not
willing to delay the acquisition for a moment. She had been taught a
very different lesson. Marriage included vows of irrevocable affection
and obedience. It was a contract to endure for life. To form this
connection in extreme youth, before time had unfolded and modelled the
characters of the parties, was, in her opinion, a proof of pernicious
and opprobrious temerity. Not to perceive the propriety of delay in this
case, or to be regardless of the motives that would enjoin upon us a
deliberate procedure, furnished an unanswerable objection to any man's
pretensions. She was sensible, however, that this, like other mistakes,
was curable. If her arguments failed to remove it, time, it was likely,
would effect this purpose. If she rejected a matrimonial proposal for
the present, it was for reasons that might not preclude her future
acceptance of it.

Her scruples, in the present case, did not relate to the temper or
person, or understanding of her lover; but to his age, to the
imperfectness of their acquaintance, and to the want of that permanence
of character, which can flow only from the progress of time and
knowledge. These objections, which so rarely exist, were conclusive
with her. There was no danger of her relinquishing them in compliance
with the remonstrances of her parents and the solicitations of her
lover; though the one and the other were urged with all the force of
authority and insinuation. The prescriptions of duty were too clear to
allow her to hesitate and waver; but the consciousness of rectitude
could not secure her from temporary vexations.

Her parents were blemished with some of the frailties of that character.
They held themselves entitled to prescribe in this article, but they
forbore to exert their power. They condescended to persuade, but it was
manifest that they regarded their own conduct as a relaxation of right;
and had not the lever's importunities suddenly ceased, it is not
possible to tell how far the happiness of Miss Dudley might have been
endangered. The misfortunes of her father were no sooner publicly
known, than the youth forbore his visits, and embarked on a voyage which
he had long projected, but which had been hitherto delayed by a superior
regard to the interests of his passion.

It must be allowed that the lady had not foreseen this event. She had
exercised her judgment upon his character, and had not been deceived.
Before this desertion, had it been clearly stated to her apprehension,
she would have readily admitted it to be probable. She knew the
fascination of wealth, and the delusiveness of self-confidence. She was
superior to the folly of supposing him exempt from sinister influences,
and deaf to the whispers of ambition; and yet the manner in which she
was affected by this event convinced her that her heart had a larger
share than her reason in dictating her expectations.

Yet it must not be supposed that she suffered any very acute distress on
this account. She was grieved less for her own sake than his. She had
no design of entering into marriage in less than seven years from this
period. Not a single hope, relative to her own condition, had been
frustrated. She had only been mistaken in her favourable conceptions of
another. He had exhibited less constancy and virtue than her heart had
taught her to expect.

With those opinions, she could devote herself with a single heart to the
alleviation of her parent's sorrows. This change in her condition she
treated lightly, and retained her cheerfulness unimpaired. This happened
because, in a rational estimate, and so far as it affected herself, the
misfortune was slight, and because her dejection would only tend to
augment the disconsolateness of her parents, while, on the other hand,
her serenity was calculated to infuse the same confidence into them. She
indulged herself in no fits of exclamation or moodiness. She listened
in silence to their invectives and laments, and seized every opportunity
that offered to inspire them with courage, to set before them the good
as well as the ill to which they were reserved, to suggest expedients
for improving their condition, and to soften the asperities of his new
mode of life, to her father, by every species of blandishment and
tenderness.

She refused no personal exertion to the common benefit. She incited her
father to diligence, as well by her example as by her exhortations;
suggested plans, and superintended or assisted in the execution of them.
The infirmities of sex and age vanished before the motives to courage
and activity, flowing from her new situation. When settled in his new
abode and profession, she began to deliberate what conduct was incumbent
on herself, how she might participate with her father the burden of the
common maintenance, and blunt the edge of this calamity by the resources
of a powerful and cultivated mind.

In the first place, she disposed of every superfluous garb and trinket
She reduced her wardrobe to the plainest and cheapest establishment. By
this means alone she supplied her father's necessities with a
considerable sum. Her music, and even her books were not spared,--not
from the slight esteem in which these were held by her, but because she
was thenceforth to become an economist of time as well as of money,
because musical instruments are not necessary to the practice of this
art in its highest perfection, and because books, when she could procure
leisure to read, or money to purchase them, might be obtained in a
cheaper and more commodious form, than those costly and splendid volumes
with which her father's munificence had formerly supplied her.

To make her expenses as limited as possible was her next care. For this
end she assumed the province of cook, the washing of house and clothes,
and the cleaning of furniture. Their house was small; the family
consisted of no more than four persons, and all formality and
expensiveness were studiously discarded; but her strength was unequal to
unavoidable tasks. A vigorous constitution could not supply the place of
laborious habits, and this part of her plan must have been changed for
one less frugal. The aid of a servant must have been hired, if it had
not been furnished by gratitude.

Some years before this misfortune, her mother had taken under her
protection a girl, the daughter of a poor woman, who subsisted by
labour, and who dying, left this child without friend or protector.
This girl possessed no very improvable capacity, and therefore could not
benefit by the benevolent exertions of her young mistress so much as the
latter desired; but her temper was artless and affectionate, and she
attached herself to Constantia with the most entire devotion. In this
change of fortune she would not consent to be separated; and Miss
Dudley, influenced by her affection for her Lucy, and reflecting that on
the whole it was most to her advantage to share with her at once her
kindness and her poverty, retained her as her companion. With this girl
she shared the domestic duties, scrupling not to divide with her the
meanest and most rugged, as well as the lightest offices.

This was not all. She in the next place considered whether her ability
extended no farther than to save. Could she not by the employment of her
hands increase the income as well as diminish the expense? Why should
she be precluded from all lucrative occupation? She soon came to a
resolution. She was mistress of her needle; and this skill she conceived
herself bound to employ for her own subsistence.

Clothing is one of the necessaries of human existence. The art of the
tailor is scarcely less use than that of the tiller of the ground! There
are few the gains of which are better merited, and less infurious to the
principles of human society. She resolved therefore to become a
workwoman, and to employ in this way the leisure she possessed from
household avocations. To this scheme she was obliged to reconcile not
only herself but her parents. The conquest of their prejudices was no
easy task, but her patience and skill finally succeeded, and she
procured needlework in sufficient quantity to enable her to enhance in
no trivial degree the common fund.

It is one thing barely to comply with the urgencies of the case, and to
do that which in necessitous circumstances is best. But to conform with
grace and cheerfulness, to yield no place to fruitless recriminations
and repinings, to contract the evils into as small a compass as
possible, and extract from our condition all possible good, is a task of
a different kind.

Mr. Dudley's situation required from him frugality and diligence. He was
regular and unintermitted in his application to his pen. He was frugal.
His slender income was administered agreeably to the maxims of his
daughter: but he was unhappy. He experienced in its full extent the
bitterness of disappointment.

He gave himself up for the most part to a listless melancholy. Sometimes
his impatience would produce effects less excusable, and conjure up an
accusing and irascible spirit. His wife, and even his daughter, he would
make the objects of peevish and absurd reproaches. These were moments
when her heart drooped indeed, and her tears could not be restrained
from flowing. These fits were transitory and rare, and when they had
passed, the father seldom failed to mingle tokens of contrition and
repentance with the tears of his daughter. Her arguments and soothings
were seldom disappointed of success. Her mother's disposition was soft
and pliant, but she could not accommodate herself to the necessity of
her husband's affairs. She was obliged to endure the want of some
indulgences, but she reserved to herself the liberty of complaining, and
to subdue this spirit in her was found utterly impracticable. She died a
victim to discontent.

This event deepened the gloom that shrouded the soul of her father, and
rendered the task of consolation still more difficult. She did not
despair. Her sweetness and patience was invincible by any thing that had
already happened, but her fortitude did not exceed the standard of
human nature. Evils now began to menace her, to which it is likely she
would have yielded, had not their approach been intercepted by an evil
of a different kind.

The pressure of grief is sometimes such as to prompt us to seek a refuge
in voluntary death. We must lay aside the burden which we cannot
sustain. If thought degenerate into a vehicle of pain, what remains but
to destroy that vehicle? For this end, death is the obvious, but not the
only, or morally speaking, the worst means. There is one method of
obtaining the bliss of forgetfulness, in comparison with which suicide
is innocent.

The strongest mind is swayed by circumstances. There is no firmness of
integrity, perhaps able to repel every species of temptation, which is
produced by the present constitution of human affairs, and yet
temptation is successful, chiefly by virtue of its gradual and
invisible approaches. We rush into danger, because we are not aware of
its existence, and have not therefore provided the means of safety, and
the dæmon that seizes us is hourly reinforced by habit. Our opposition
grows fainter in proportion as our adversary acquires new strength, and
the man becomes enslaved by the most sordid vices, whose fall would, at
a former period, have been deemed impossible, or who would have been
imagined liable to any species of depravity, more than to this.

Mr. Dudley's education had entailed upon him many errors, yet who would
have supposed it possible for him to be enslaved by a depraved appetite;
to be enamoured of low debauchery, and to grasp at the happiness that
intoxication had to bestow? This was a mournful period in Constantia's
history. My feelings will not suffer me to dwell upon it. I cannot
describe the manner in which she was affected by the first symptoms of
this depravity, the struggles which she made to counteract this dreadful
infatuation, and the grief which she experienced from the repeated
miscarriage of her efforts. I will not detail her various expedients for
this end, the appeals which she made to his understanding, to his sense
of honour and dread of infamy, to the gratitude to which she was
entitled, and to the injunctions of parental duty. I will not detail his
fits of remorse, his fruitless penitence end continual relapses, nor
depict the heart-breaking scenes of uproar, and violence, and foul
disgrace that accompanied his paroxysms of drunkenness.

The only intellectual amusement which this lady allowed herself was
writing. She enjoyed one distant friend, with whom she maintained an
uninterrupted correspondence, and to whom she confided a circumstantial
and copious relation of all these particulars. That friend is the writer
of these memoirs. It is not impossible but that these letters may be
communicated to the world, at some future period. The picture which they
exhibit is hourly exemplified and realized, though in the many-coloured
scenes of human life none surpasses it in disastrousness and horror. My
eyes almost wept themselves dry over this part of her tale.

In this state of things Mr. Dudley's blindness might justly be
accounted, even in its immediate effects, a fortunate event. It
dissolved the spell by which he was bound, and which it is probable
would never have been otherwise broken. It restored him to himself, and
showed him, with a distinctness which made him shudder, the gulf to
which he was hastening. But nothing can compensate to the sufferers the
evils of blindness. It was the business of Constantia's life to
alleviate those sufferings, to cherish and console her father, and to
rescue him by the labour of her hands from dependence on public
charity. For this end, her industry and solicitude were never at rest.
She was able, by that industry, to provide him and herself with
necessaries. Their portion was scanty, and if it sometimes exceeded the
standard of their wants, not less frequently fell short of it. For all
her toils and disquietudes she esteemed herself fully compensated by the
smiles of her father. He indeed could seldom be prompted to smile, or to
suppress the dictates of that despair which flowed from his sense of
this new calamity, and the aggravations of hardship which his recent
insobrieties had occasioned to his daughter.

She purchased what books her scanty stock would allow, and borrowed
others. These she read to him when her engagements would permit. At
other times she was accustomed to solace herself with her own music. The
lute which her father had purchased in Italy, and which had been
disposed of among the rest of his effects, at public sale, had been
gratuitously restored to him by the purchaser, on condition of his
retaining it in his possession. His blindness and inoccupation now broke
the long silence to which this instrument had been condemned, and
afforded an accompaniment to the young lady's voice.

Her chief employment was conversation. She resorted to this as the best
means of breaking the monotony of the scene; but this purpose was not
only accomplished, but other benefits of the highest value accrued from
it. The habits of a painter eminently tended to vivify and make exact
her father's conceptions and delineations of visible objects. The sphere
of his youthful observation comprised more ingredients of the
picturesque than any other sphere. The most precious materials of the
moral history of mankind are derived from the revolutions of Italy.
Italian features and landscape constitute the chosen field of the
artists. No one had more carefully explored this field than Mr. Dudley.
His time, when abroad, had been divided between residence at Rome, and
excursions to Calabria and Tuscany. Few impressions were effaced from
his capacious register, and these were now rendered by his eloquence
nearly as conspicuous to his companion as to himself.

She was imbued with an ardent thirst of knowledge, and by the acuteness
of her remarks, and the judiciousness of her inquiries, reflected back
upon his understanding as much improvement as she received. These
efforts to render his calamity tolerable, and inure him to the profiting
by his own resources, were aided by time, and when reconciled by habit
to unrespited gloom, he was sometimes visited by gleams of cheerfulness,
and drew advantageous comparisons between his present and former
situation. A stillness, not unakin to happiness, frequently diffused
itself over their winter evenings. Constantia enjoyed in their full
extent the felicities of health and self approbation. The genius and
eloquence of her father, nourished by perpetual exercise, and undiverted
from its purpose by the intrusion of visible objects, frequently
afforded her a delight in comparison with which all other pleasures were
mean.




CHAPTER III.


This period of tranquillity was short. Poverty hovered at their
threshold, and in a state precarious as theirs could not be long
excluded. The lady was more accustomed to anticipate good than evil, but
she was not unconscious that the winter, which was hastening, would
bring with it numerous inconveniences. Wants during that season are
multiplied, while the means of supplying them either fail or are
diminished. Fuel is alone a cause of expense equal to all other articles
of subsistence. Her dwelling was old, crazy, and full of avenues to air.
It was evident that neither fire nor clothing would, in an habitation
like that, attemper the chilling blasts. Her scanty gains were equal to
their needs during summer, but would probably fall short during the
prevalence of cold.

These reflections could not fail sometimes to intrude. She indulged them
as long as they served, merely to suggest expedients and provisions for
the future, but laboured to call away her attention when they merely
produced anxiety. This she more easily effected, as some months of
summer were still to come, and her knowledge of the vicissitudes to
which human life is subject taught her to rely upon the occurrence of
some fortunate though unforeseen event.

Accident suggested an expedient of this kind. Passing through an alley
in the upper part of the town, her eye was caught by a label on the door
of a small house, signifying that it was to be let. It was smaller than
that she at present occupied, but it had an aspect of much greater
comfort and neatness. Its situation near the centre of the city, in a
quiet, cleanly, and well paved alley, was far preferable to that of her
present habitation in the suburbs, scarcely accessible in winter for
pools and gullies, and in a neighbourhood abounding with indigence and
profligacy. She likewise considered that the rent of this might be less,
and that the proprietor of this might have more forbearance and
benignity than she had hitherto met with.

Unconversant as she was with the world, imbued with the timidity of her
sex and her youth, many enterprises were arduous to her, which would, to
age and experience, have been easy. Her reluctances, however, when
required by necessity, were overcome, and all the measures which her
situation prescribed executed with address and dispatch. One, marking
her deportment, would have perceived nothing but dignity and courage. He
would have regarded these as the fruits of habitual independence and
exertion, whereas they were merely the results of clear perceptions and
inflexible resolves.

The proprietor of this mansion was immediately sought out, and a
bargain, favourable as she could reasonably desire, concluded.
Possession was to be taken in a week. For this end, carters and draymen
were to be engaged, household implements to be prepared for removal, and
negligence and knavery prevented by scrupulous attention. The duties of
superintendence and execution devolved upon her. Her father's blindness
rendered him powerless. His personal ease required no small portion of
care. Household and professional functions were not to be omitted. She
stood alone in the world; there was none whose services or counsel she
could claim. Tortured by a multiplicity of cares, shrinking from
exposure to rude eyes, and from contention with refractory and insolent
spirits, and overpowered with fatigue and disgust, she was yet compelled
to retain a cheerful tone in her father's presence, and to struggle
with his regrets and his peevishness.

O, my friend, methinks I now see thee encountering the sneers and
obstinacy of the meanest of mankind, subjecting that frame of thine, so
exquisitely delicate, and therefore so feeble, to the vilest drudgery. I
see thee leading thy unhappy father to his new dwelling, and stifling
the sighs produced by his fruitless repinings and unseasonable scruples.
Why was I not partaker of thy cares and labours? Why was I severed from
thee by the ocean, and kept in ignorance of thy state? I was not without
motives to anxiety, for I was friendless as thou, but how unlike to
thine was my condition! I reposed upon down and tissue, never moved but
with obsequious attendance and pompous equipage; painting and music were
consolations ever at hand, and my cabinet was stored with poetry and
science. These, indeed, were insufficient to exclude care; and with
regard to the past I have no wish but that I had shared with my friend
her toilsome and humiliating lot. However an erroneous world might
judge, thy life was full of dignity, and thy moments of happiness not
few, since happiness is only attendant on the performance of our duty.

A toilsome and sultry week was terminated by a Sabbath of repose. Her
new dwelling possessed indisputable advantages over her old. Not the
least of these benefits consisted in the vicinity of people, peaceable
and honest, though poor. She was no longer shocked by the clamours of
debauchery, and exposed, by her situation, to the danger of being
mistaken by the profligate of either sex for one of their own class. It
was reasonable to consider this change of abode as fortunate, and yet
circumstances quickly occurred which suggested a very different
conclusion.

She had no intercourse, which necessity did not prescribe, with the
rest of the world. She screened herself as much as possible from
intercourse with prying and loquacious neighbours. Her father's
inclinations in this respect coincided with her own, though their love
of seclusion was prompted by different motives. Visitants were hated by
the father, because his dignity was hurt by communication with the
vulgar. The daughter set too much value upon time willingly to waste it
upon trifles and triflers. She had no pride to subdue, and therefore
never escaped from well-meant importunity at the expense of politeness
and good humour. In her moments of leisure she betook herself to the
poet and the moralist for relief.

She could not at all times suppress the consciousness of the evils which
surrounded and threatened her; she could not but rightly estimate the
absorbing and brutifying nature of that toil to which she was condemned.
Literature had hitherto been regarded as her solace. She knew that
meditation and converse, as well as books and the pen, are instruments
of knowledge, but her musing thoughts were too often fixed upon her own
condition. Her father's soaring moods and luminous intervals grew less
frequent. Conversation was too rarely abstracted from personal
considerations, and strayed less often than before into the wilds of
fancy or the mazes of analysis.

These circumstances led her to reflect whether subsistence might not be
obtained by occupations purely intellectual. Instruction was needed by
the young of both sexes. Females frequently performed the office of
teachers. Was there no branch of her present knowledge which she might
claim wages for imparting to others? Was there no art within her reach
to acquire, convertible into means of gain? Women are generally limited
to what is sensual and ornamental: music and painting, and the Italian
and French languages, are bounds which they seldom pass. In these
pursuits it is not possible--nor is it expected--that they should arrive
at the skill of adepts. The education of Constantia had been regulated
by the peculiar views of her father, who sought to make her, not
alluring and voluptuous, but eloquent and wise. He therefore limited her
studies to Latin and English. Instead of familiarizing her with the
amorous effusions of Petrarcha and Racine, he made her thoroughly
conversant with Tacitus and Milton. Instead of making her a practical
musician or pencilist, he conducted her to the school of Newton and
Hartley, unveiled to her the mathematical properties of light and sound,
taught her as a metaphysician and anatomist the structure and power of
the senses, and discussed with her the principles and progress of human
society.

These accomplishments tended to render her superior to the rest of
women but in no degree qualified her for the post of a female
instructor: she saw and lamented her deficiencies, and gradually formed
the resolution of supplying them. Her knowledge of the Latin tongue and
of grammatical principles rendered easy the acquisition of Italian and
French, these being merely Scions from the Roman stock.

Having had occasion, previous to her change of dwelling, to purchase
paper at a bookseller's, the man had offered her at a very low price a
second-hand copy of Veneroni's grammar: the offer had been declined, her
views at that time being otherwise directed. Now, however, this incident
was remembered, and a resolution instantly formed to purchase the book.
As soon as the light declined, and her daily task at the needle had
drawn to a close, she set out to execute this purpose. Arriving at the
house of the bookseller, she perceived that the doors and windows were
closed. Night having not yet arrived, the conjecture easily occurred
that some one had died in the house. She had always dealt with this man
for books and paper, and had always been treated with civility. Her
heart readily admitted some sympathy with his distress, and to remove
her doubts she turned to a person who stood at the entrance of the next
house, and who held a cloth steeped in vinegar to his nostrils. In
reply to her question the stranger said in a tone of the deepest
consternation--Mr. Watson do you mean? He is dead: he died last night of
the _yellow fever_.

The name of this disease was not absolutely new to her ears. She had
been apprized of its rapid and destructive progress in one quarter of
the city, but hitherto it had existed, with regard to her, chiefly in
the form of rumour. She had not realized the nature or probable extent
of the evil. She lived at no great distance from the seat of the malady,
but her neighbourhood had been hitherto exempt. So wholly unused was
she to contemplate pestilence, except at a distance, that its actual
existence in the bosom of this city was incredible.

Contagious diseases she well knew periodically visited and laid waste
the Greek and Egyptian cities. It constituted no small part of that mass
of evil, political and physical, by which that portion of the world has
been so long afflicted. That a pest equally malignant had assailed the
metropolis of her own country--a town famous for the salubrity of its
air and the perfection of its police--had something in it so wild and
uncouth that she could not reconcile herself to the possibility of such
an event.

The death of Watson, however, filled her mind with awful reflections.
The purpose of her walk was forgotten amidst more momentous
considerations. She bent her steps pensively homeward. She had now
leisure to remark the symptoms of terror with which all ranks appeared
to have been seized. The streets were as much frequented as ever, but
there were few passengers whose countenances did not betray alarm, and
who did not employ the imaginary antidote to infection--vinegar.

Having reached home, she quickly discovered in her father an unusual
solemnity and thoughtfulness. He had no power to conceal his emotions
from his daughter, when her efforts to discover them were earnestly
exerted. She learned that during her absence he had been visited by his
next neighbour--a thrifty, sober, and well meaning, but ignorant and
meddling person, by name Whiston. This person, being equally inquisitive
into other men's affairs, and communicative of his own, was always an
unwelcome visitant. On this occasion he had come to disburden on Mr.
Dudley his fears of disease and death. His tale of the origin and
progress of the epidemic, of the number and suddenness of recent deaths,
was delivered with endless prolixity. With this account he mingled
prognostics of the future, counselled Mr. Dudley to fly from the scene
of danger, and stated his own schemes and resolutions. After having
thoroughly affrighted and wearied his companion he took his leave.

Constantia endeavoured to remove the impression which had been thus
needlessly made. She urged her doubts as to the truth of Whiston's
representations, and endeavoured, in various ways, to extenuate the
danger.

"Nay, my child," said her father, "thou needest not reason on the
subject; I am not afraid; at least, on my own account, I fear nothing.
What is life to me that I should dread to lose it? If on any account I
should tremble it is on thine, my angelic girl. Thou dost not deserve
thus early to perish: and yet if my love for thee were rational, perhaps
I ought to wish it. An evil destiny will pursue thee to the close of thy
life, be it ever so long.

"I know that ignorance and folly breed the phantoms by which themselves
are perplexed and terrified, and that Whiston is a fool; but here the
truth is too plain to be disguised. This malady is pestilential. Havock
and despair will accompany its progress, and its progress will be rapid.
The tragedies of Marseilles and Messina will be reacted on this stage.

"For a time we in this quarter shall be exempt, but it will surely reach
us at last; and then, whither shall we fly? For the rich, the whole
world is a safe asylum, but for us, indigent and wretched, what fate is
reserved but to stay and perish? If the disease spare us, we must perish
by neglect and famine. Alarm will be far and wide diffused. Fear will
hinder those who supply the market from entering the city. The price of
food will become exorbitant. Our present source of subsistence,
ignominious and scanty as it is, will be cut off. Traffic and labour of
every kind will be at an end. We shall die, but not until we have
witnessed and endured horrors that surpass thy powers of conception.

"I know full well the enormity of this evil. I have been at Messina, and
talked with many who witnessed the state of that city in 1743. I will
not freeze thy blood with the recital. Anticipation has a tendency to
lessen or prevent some evils, but pestilence is not of that number.
Strange untowardness of destiny! That thou and I should be cast upon a
scene like this!"

Mr. Dudley joined with uncommon powers of discernment a species of
perverseness not easily accounted for. He acted as if the inevitable
evils of her lot were not sufficient for the trial of his daughter's
patience. Instead of comforter and counsellor he fostered impatience in
himself, and endeavoured, with the utmost diligence, to undermine her
fortitude and disconcert her schemes. The task was assigned to her, not
only of subduing her own fears, but of maintaining the contest with his
disastrous eloquence. In most cases she had not failed of success.
Hitherto their causes of anxiety her own observation had, in some
degree, enabled her to estimate at their just value. The rueful pictures
which his imagination was wont to portray affected her for a moment; but
deliberate scrutiny commonly enabled her to detect and demonstrate their
fallacy. Now, however, the theme was new. Panic and foreboding found
their way to her heart in defiance of her struggles. She had no
experience by which to counteract this impulse. All that remained was to
beguile her own and her father's cares by counterfeiting cheerfulness,
and introducing new topics.

This panic, stifled for a time, renewed its sway when she retired to her
chamber. Never did futurity wear, to her fancy, so dark a hue: never did
her condition appear to her in a light so dreary and forlorn. To fly
from the danger was impossible. How should accommodation at a distance
be procured? The means of subsistence were indissolubly connected with
her present residence, but the progress of this disease would cut off
these means, and leave her to be beset not only with pestilence but
famine. What provision could she make against an evil like this?




CHAPTER IV.

The terms on which she had been admitted into this house included the
advance of one quarter's rent and the monthly payment of subsequent
dues. The requisite sum had been with difficulty collected; the landlord
had twice called to remind her of her stipulation, and this day had been
fixed for the discharge of this debt. He had omitted, contrary to her
expectations and her wishes, to come. It was probable, however, that
they would meet on the ensuing day. If he should fail in this respect,
it appeared to be her duty to carry the money to his house, and this it
had been her resolution to perform.

Now, however, new views were suggested to her thoughts. By the payment
of this debt she would leave herself nearly destitute. The flight and
terror of the citizens would deprive her of employment. Want of food
was an immediate and inevitable evil which the payment of this sum would
produce. Was it just to incur this evil? To retain the means of
luxurious gratification would be wrong, but to bereave herself and her
father of bare subsistence was surely no dictate of duty.

It is true the penalty of non-payment was always in the landlord's
hands. He was empowered by the law to sell their movables end expel them
from his house. It was now no time for a penalty like this to be
incurred. But from this treatment it was reasonable to hope that his
lenity would save them. Was it not right to wait till the alternative of
expulsion or payment was imposed? Meanwhile, however, she was subjected
to the torments of suspense, and to the guilt of a broken promise. These
consequences were to be eluded only in one way: by visiting her
landlord, and stating her true condition, it was possible that his
compassion would remit claims which were in themselves unreasonable and
uncommon. The tender of the money, accompanied by representations
sufficiently earnest and pathetic, might possibly be declined.

These reflections were the next morning submitted to her father. Her
decision in this case was of less importance in his eyes than in those
of his daughter. Should the money be retained, it was in his opinion a
pittance too small to afford them effectual support. Supposing
provisions to be had at any price, which was itself improbable, that
price would be exorbitant. The general confusion would probably last for
months, and thirty dollars would be devoured in a few weeks, even in a
time of safety. To give or to keep was indifferent for another reason.
It was absurd for those to consult about means of subsistence for the
next month, when it was fixed that they should die to-morrow. The true
proceeding was obvious. The landlord's character was well known to him
by means of the plaints and invectives of their neighbours, most of whom
were tenants of the same man. If the money were offered his avarice
would receive it, in spite of all the pleas that she should urge. If it
were detained without leave, an officer of justice would quickly be
dispatched to claim it.

This statement was sufficient to take away from Constantia the hope that
she had fostered. "What then," said she, after a pause, "is my father's
advice? Shall I go forthwith and deliver the money?"

"No," said he, "stay till he sends for it. Have you forgotten that
Matthews resides in the very midst of this disease. There is no need to
thrust yourself within in its fangs. They will reach us time enough. It
is likely his messenger will be an agent of the law. No matter. The debt
will be merely increased by a few charges. In a state like ours, the
miserable remnant is not worth caring for."

This reasoning did not impart conviction to the lady. The danger flowing
from a tainted atmosphere was not small, but to incur that danger was
wiser than to exasperate their landlord, to augment the debt, and to
encounter the disgrace accruing from a constable's visits. The
conversation was dropped, and presently after she set out on a visit to
Matthews.

She fully estimated the importance to her happiness of the sum which she
was going to pay. The general panic had already, in some degree,
produced the effect she chiefly dreaded; the failure of employment for
her needle. Her father had, with his usual diligence at self-torment,
supplied her with sufficient proofs of the covetous and obdurate temper
of her creditor. Insupportable, however, as the evil of payment was, it
was better to incur it spontaneously, than by means of legal process.
The desperateness of this proceeding, therefore, did not prevent her
from adopting it, but it filled her heart with the bitterest sensations.
Absorbed, as she passed along, by these, she was nearly insensible to
the vacancy which now prevailed in a quarter which formerly resounded
with the din of voices and carriages.

As she approached the house to which she was going, her reluctance to
proceed increased. Frequently she paused to recollect the motives that
had prescribed this task, and to reinforce her purposes. At length she
arrived at the house. Now, for the first time, her attention was excited
by the silence and desolation that surrounded her. This evidence of fear
and of danger struck upon her heart. All appeared to have fled from the
presence of this unseen and terrible foe. The temerity of adventuring
thus into the jaws of the pest now appeared to her in glaring colours.

Appearances suggested a refection which had not previously occurred,
and which tended to console her. Was it not probable that Matthews had
likewise flown? His habits were calculated to endear to him his life: he
would scarcely be among the last to shun perils like these: The omission
of his promised visit on the preceding day might be owing to his absence
from the city, and thus, without subjection to any painful alternative,
she might be suffered to retain the money.

To give certainty to this hope, she cast her eye towards the house
opposite to which she now stood. Her heart drooped on perceiving proofs
that the dwelling was still inhabited. The door was open, and the
windows in the second and third story were raised. Near the entrance, in
the street, stood a cart. The horse attached to it, in its form and
furniture and attitude, was an emblem of torpor and decay. His gaunt
sides, motionless limbs, his gummy and dead eyes, and his head hanging
to the ground, were in unison with the craziness of the vehicle to which
he belonged, and the paltry and bedusted harness which covered him. No
attendant nor any human face was visible. The stillness, though at an
hour customarily busy, was uninterrupted except by the sound of wheels
moving at an almost indistinguishable distance.

She paused for a moment to contemplate this unwonted spectacle. Her
trepidations were mingled with emotions not unakin to sublimity, but the
consciousness of danger speedily prevailed, and she hastened to acquit
herself of her engagement. She approached the door for this purpose, but
before she could draw the bell, her motions were arrested by sounds from
within. The staircase was opposite the door. Two persons were now
discovered descending the stairs. They lifted between them a heavy mass,
which was presently discerned to be a coffin. Shocked by this discovery,
and trembling, she withdrew from the entrance.

At this moment a door on the opposite side of the street opened, and a
female came out. Constantia approached her involuntarily, and her
appearance not being unattractive, ventured more by gestures than by
words, to inquire whose obsequies were thus unceremoniously conducted.
The woman informed her that the dead was Matthews, who, two days before
was walking about, indifferent to and braving danger. She cut short the
narrative which her companion seemed willing to prolong, and to
embellish with all its circumstances, and hastened home with her utmost
expedition.

The mind of Constantia was a stranger to pusillanimity. Death, as the
common lot of all, was regarded by her without perturbation. The value
of life, though no annihilated, was certainly diminished by adversity.
With whatever solemnity contemplated, it excited on her own account no
aversion or inquietude. For her father's sake only death was an evil to
be ardently deprecated. The nature of the prevalent disease, the limits
and modes of its influence, the risk that is incurred by approaching the
sick or the dead, or by breathing the surrounding element, were subjects
foreign to her education. She judged like the mass of mankind from the
most obvious appearances, and was subject like them to impulses which
disdained the control of her reason. With all her complacency for death,
and speculative resignation to the fate that governs the world, disquiet
and alarm pervaded her bosom on this occasion.

The deplorable state to which her father would be reduced by her death
was seen and lamented, but her tremulous sensations flowed not from this
source. They were, in some sort, inexplicable and mechanical. In spite
of recollection and reflection, they bewildered and harassed her, and
subsided only of their own accord.

The death of Matthews was productive of one desirable consequence. Till
the present tumult was passed, and his representatives had leisure to
inspect his affairs, his debtors would probably remain unmolested. He
likewise, who should succeed to the inheritance, might possess very
different qualities, and be as much, distinguished for equity as
Matthews had been for extortion. These reflections lightened her
footsteps as she hied homeward. The knowledge she had gained, she hoped,
would counterpoise, in her father's apprehension, the perils which
accompanied the acquisition of it.

She had scarcely passed her own threshold, when she was followed by
Whiston. This man pursued the occupation of a cooper. He performed
journeywork in a shop, which, unfortunately for him, was situated near
the water, and at a small distance from the scene of original infection.
This day his employer had dismissed his workmen, and Whiston was at
liberty to retire from the city,--a scheme which had been the theme of
deliberation and discussion during the preceding fortnight.

Hitherto his apprehensions seemed to have molested others more than
himself. The rumours and conjectures industriously collected during the
day, were, in the the evening, copiously detailed to his neighbours, and
his own mind appeared to be disburdened of its cares in proportion as he
filled others with terror and inquietude. The predictions of physicians,
the measure of precaution prescribed by the government, the progress of
the malady, and the history of the victims who were hourly destroyed by
it, were communicated with tormenting prolixity and terrifying
minuteness.

On these accounts, as well as on others, no one's visits were more
unwelcome than his. As his deportment was sober and honest, and his
intentions harmless, he was always treated by Constantia with
politeness, though his entrance always produced a momentary depression
of her spirits. On this evening she was less fitted than ever to repel
those anxieties which his conversation was qualified to produce. His
entrance, therefore, was observed with sincere regret.

Contrary, however, to her expectation, Whiston brought with him new
manners and a new expression of countenance. He was silent, abstracted,
his eye was full of inquietude, and wandered with perpetual
restlessness. On these tokens being remarked, he expressed, in faltering
accents, his belief that he had contracted this disease, and that now it
was too late for him to leave the city.

Mr. Dudley's education was somewhat medical. He was so far interested in
his guest as to inquire into his sensations. They were such as were
commonly the prelude to fever. Mr Dudley, while he endeavoured by
cheerful tones to banish his dejection, exhorted him to go home, and to
take some hot and wholesome draught, in consequence of which he might
rise to-morrow with his usual health. This advice was gratefully
received, and Whiston put a period to his visit much sooner than was
customary.

Mr. Dudley entertained no doubts that Whiston was seized with the
reigning disease, and extinguished the faint hope which his daughter had
cherished, that their district would escape. Whiston's habituation was
nearly opposite his own; but as they made no use of their front room,
they had seldom an opportunity of observing the transactions of their
neighbours. This distance and seclusion were congenial with her
feelings, and she derived pleasure from her father's confession, that
they contributed to personal security.

Constantia was accustomed to rise with the dawn, and traverse for an
hour the State-house Mall. As she took her walk the next morning, she
pondered with astonishment on the present situation of the city. The air
was bright and pure, and apparently salubrious. Security and silence
seemed to hover over the scene. She was only reminded of the true state
of things by the occasional appearance of carriages loaded with
household utensils tending towards the country, and by the odour of
vinegar by which every passenger was accompanied. The public walk was
cool and fragrant as formerly, skirted by verdure as bright, and shaded
by foliage as luxuriant, but it was no longer frequented by lively steps
and cheerful countenances. Its solitude was uninterrupted by any but
herself.

This day passed without furnishing any occasion to leave the house. She
was less sedulously employed than usual, as the clothes on which she was
engaged belonged to a family who had precipitately left the city. She
had leisure therefore to ruminate. She could not but feel some concern
in the fate of Whiston. He was a young man, who subsisted on the fruits
of his labour, and divided his gains with an only sister who lived with
him, and who performed every household office.

This girl was humble and innocent, and of a temper affectionate and
mild. Casual intercourse only had taken place between her and
Constantia. They were too dissimilar for any pleasure to arise from
communication, but the latter was sufficiently disposed to extend to her
harmless neighbour the sympathy and succour which she needed. Whiston
had come from a distant part of the country, and his sister was the only
person in the city with whom he was connected by ties of kindred. In
case of his sickness, therefore, their condition would be helpless and
deplorable.

Evening arrived, and Whiston failed to pay his customary visit. She
mentioned this omission to her father, and expressed her apprehension as
to the cause of it. He did not discountenance the inference which she
drew from this circumstance, and assented to the justice of the picture
which she drew of the calamitous state to which Whiston and his sister
would be reduced by the indisposition of either. She then ventured to
suggest the propriety of visiting the house, and of thus ascertaining
the truth.

To this proposal Mr. Dudley urged the most vehement objections. What
purpose could be served by entering their dwelling? What benefit would
flow but the gratification of a dangerous curiosity? Constantia was
disabled from furnishing pecuniary aid. She could not act the part of
physician or nurse. Her father stood in need of a thousand personal
services, and the drudgery of cleaning and cooking already exceeded the
bounds of her strength. The hazard of contracting the disease by
conversing with the sick was imminent. What services was she able to
render equivalent to the consequences of her own sickness and death?

These representations had temporary influence. They recalled her for a
moment from her purpose, but this purpose was speedily re-embraced. She
reflected that the evil to herself, formidable as it was, was barely
problematical. That converse with the sick would impart this disease was
by no means certain. Whiston might at least be visited. Perhaps she
would find him well. If sick, his disease might be unepidemical, or
curable by seasonable assistance. He might stand in need of a physician,
and she was more able than his sister to summon this aid.

Her father listened calmly to her reasonings. After a pause he gave his
consent. In doing this he was influenced not by the conviction that his
daughter's safety would be exposed to no hazard, but from a belief that,
though she might shun infection for the present, it would inevitably
seize her during some period of the progress of this pest.




CHAPTER V.


It was now dusk, and she hastened to perform this duty. Whiston's
dwelling was wooden and of small dimensions. She lifted the latch softly
and entered. The lower room was unoccupied. She advanced to the foot of
a narrow staircase, and knocked and listened, but no answer was returned
to the summons. Hence there was reason to infer that no one was within,
but this, from other considerations, was extremely improbable. The truth
could be ascertained only by ascending the stairs. Some feminine
scruples were to be subdued before this proceeding could be adopted.

After some hesitation, she determined to ascend. The staircase was
terminated by a door, at which she again knocked for admission, but in
vain. She listened and presently heard the motion as of some one in
bed. This was succeeded by tokens of vehement exertions to vomit. These
signs convincing her that the house was not without a tenant, she could
not hesitate to enter the room.

Lying in a tattered bed, she now discovered Mary Whiston. Her face was
flushed and swelled, her eyes closed, and some power, appeared to have
laid a leaden hand upon her faculties. The floor was moistened and
stained by the effusion from her stomach. Constantia touched her hand,
and endeavoured to rouse her. It was with difficulty that her attention
was excited. Her languid eyes, were scarcely opened before they again
closed, and she sunk into forgetfulness.

Repeated efforts, however, at length recalled her to herself, and
extorted from her some account of her condition. On the day before, at
noon, her stomach became diseased, her head dizzy, and her limbs unable
to support her. Her brother was absent, and her drowsiness, interrupted
only by paroxysms of vomiting, continued till his return late in the
evening. He had then shown himself, for a few minutes, at her bedside,
had made some inquiries and precipitately retired, since when he had not
reappeared.

It was natural to imagine that Whiston had gone to procure medical
assistance. That he had not returned, during a day and a half, was
matter of surprise. His own indisposition was recollected, and his
absence could only be accounted for by supposing that sickness had
disabled him from regaining his own house. What was his real destiny it
was impossible to conjecture. It was not till some months after this
period that satisfactory intelligence was gained upon this head.

It appeared that Whiston had allowed his terrors to overpower the sense
of what was due to his sister and to humanity. On discovering the
condition of the unhappy girl, he left the houses and, instead of
seeking a physician, he turned his step towards the country. After
travelling some hours, being exhausted by want of food, by fatigue; and
by mental as well as bodily anguish, he laid himself down under the
shelter of a hayrick, in a vacant field. Here he was discovered in the
morning by the inhabitants of a neighbouring farm house. These people
had too much regard for their own safety to accommodate him under their
roof, or even to approach within fifty paces of his person.

A passenger whose attention and compassion had been excited by this
incident was endowed with more courage. He lifted the stranger in his
arms, and carried him from this unwholesome spot to a barn. This was the
only service which the passenger was able to perform. Whiston, deserted
by every human creature, burning with fever, tormented into madness by
thirst, spent three miserable days in agony. When dead, no one would
cover his body with earth, but he was suffered to decay by piecemeal.

The dwelling being at no great distance from the barn, could not be
wholly screened from the malignant vapour which a corpse thus neglected,
could not fail to produce.

The inhabitants were preparing, on this account, to change their abode,
but, on the eve of their departure, the master of the family became
sick. He was, in a short time, followed to the grave by his mother, his
wife, and four children.

They probably imbibed their disease from the tainted atmosphere around
them. The life of Whiston, and their own lives, might have been saved by
affording the wanderer an asylum and suitable treatment, or at least
their own deaths might have been avoided by interring his remains.

Meanwhile Constantia was occupied with reflecting on the scene before
her. Not only a physician but a nurse was wanting. The last province it
was more easy for her to supply than the former. She was acquainted with
the abode but of one physician. He lived at no small distance from this
spot. To him she immediately hastened; but he was absent, and his
numerous engagements left it wholly uncertain when he would return, and
whether he would consent to increase the number of his patients.
Direction was obtained to the residence of another, who was happily
disengaged; and who promised to attend immediately. Satisfied with this
assurance, she neglected to request directions; by which she might
regulate herself on his failing to come.

During her return her thoughts were painfully employed in considering
the mode proper for her to pursue in her present perplexing situation.
She was for the most part unacquainted with the character of those who
compelled her neighbourhood. That any would be willing to undertake the
attendance of this girl was by no means probable. As wives and mothers,
it would perhaps be unjust to require or permit it. As to herself, there
were labours and duties of her own sufficient to engross her faculties,
yet, by whatever foreign cares or tasks she was oppressed, she felt that
to desert this being was impossible.

In the absence of her friend, Mary's state exhibited no change.
Constantia, on regaining the house, lighted the remnant of a candle, and
resumed her place by the bed side of the sick girl. She impatiently
waited the arrival of the physician, but hour succeeded hour, and he
came not. All hope of his coming being extinguished, she bethought
herself that her father might be able to inform her of the best manner
of proceeding. It was likewise her duty to relieve him from the
suspense in which her absence would unavoidably plunge him.

On entering her own apartment, she found a stranger in company with Mr.
Dudley. The latter perceiving that she had returned, speedily acquainted
her with the view of their guest. His name was M'Crea; he was the nephew
of their landlord, and was now become, by reversion, the proprietor of
the house which they occupied. Matthews had been buried the preceding
day, and M'Crea, being well acquainted with the engagements which
subsisted between the deceased and Mr. Dudley, had come thus
unreasonably to demand the rent. He was not unconscious of the
inhumanity and sordidness of this proceeding, and therefore endeavoured
to disguise it by the usual pretences. All his funds were exhausted. He
came not only in his own name, but in that of Mrs. Matthews his aunt,
who was destitute of money to procure daily and indispensable
provision, and who was striving to collect a sufficient sum to enable
her and the remains of her family to fly from a spot where their lives
were in perpetual danger.

These excuses were abundantly fallacious, but Mr. Dudley was too proud
to solicit the forbearance of a man like this. He recollected that the
engagement on his part was voluntary and explicit, and he disdained to
urge his present exigences as reasons for retracting it. He expressed
the utmost readiness to comply with the demand, and merely desired him
to wait till Miss Dudley returned. From the inquietudes with which the
unusual duration of her absence had filled him, he was now relieved by
her entrance.

With an indignant and desponding heart, she complied with her father's
directions, and the money being reluctantly delivered, M'Crea took an
hasty leave. She was too deeply interested in the fate of Mary Whiston
to allow her thoughts to be diverted for the present into a new channel.
She described the desolate condition of the girl to her father, and
besought him to think of something suitable to her relief.

Mr. Dudley's humanity would not suffer him to disapprove of his
daughter's proceeding. He imagined that the symptoms of the patient
portended a fatal issue. There were certain complicated remedies which
might possibly be beneficial, but these were too costly, and the
application would demand more strength than his daughter could bestow.
He was unwilling, however, to leave any thing within his power untried.
Pharmacy had been his trade, and he had reserved, for domestic use some
of the most powerful evacuants. Constantia was supplied with some of
these, and he consented that she should spend the night with her patient
and watch their operation.

The unhappy Mary received whatever was offered, but her stomach refused
to retain it. The night was passed by Constantia without closing her
eyes. As soon as the day dawned, she prepared once more to summon the
physician, who had failed to comply with his promise. She had scarcely
left the house, however, before she met him. He pleaded his numerous
engagements in excuse for his last night's negligence, and desired her
to make haste to conduct him to the patient.

Having scrutinized her symptoms, he expressed his hopelessness of her
recovery. Being informed of the mode in which she had been treated, he
declared his approbation of it, but intimated, that these being
unsuccessful, all that remained was to furnish her with any liquid she
might choose to demand, and wait patiently for the event. During this
interview the physician surveyed the person and dress of Constantia with
an inquisitive eye. His countenance betrayed marks of curiosity and
compassion, and, had he made any approaches to confidence and
friendliness, Constantia would not have repelled them. His air was
benevolent and candid, and she estimated highly the usefulness of a
counsellor and friend in her present circumstances. Some motive,
however, hindered him from tendering his services, and in a few moments
he withdrew.

Mary's condition hourly grew worse. A corroded and gangrenous stomach
was quickly testified by the dark hue and poisonous malignity of the
matter which was frequently ejected from it. Her stuper gave place to
some degree of peevishness and restlessness. She drank the water that
was held to her lips with unspeakable avidity, and derived from this
source a momentary alleviation of her pangs. Fortunately for her
attendant her agonies were not of long duration. Constantia was absent
from her bedside as rarely and for periods as short as possible. On the
succeeding night the sufferings of the patient terminated in death.

This event took place at two o'clock, in the morning,--an hour whose
customary stillness was, if possible, increased tenfold by the
desolation of the city. The poverty of Mary and of her nurse; had
deprived the former of the benefits, resulting from the change of bed
and clothes. Every thing about her was in a condition noisome and
detestable. Her yellowish and haggard visage, conspicuous by a feeble
light, an atmosphere freighted with malignant vapours, and reminding
Constantia at every instant of the perils which encompassed her, the
consciousness of solitude and sensations of deadly sickness in her own
frame, were sufficient to intimidate a soul of firmer texture than hers.

She was sinking fast into helplessness, when a new train of reflections
showed her the necessity of perseverance. All that remained was to
consign the corpse to the grave. She knew that vehicles for this end
were provided at the public expense; that, notice being given of the
occasion there was for their attendance, at receptacle and carriage for
the dead would be instantly provided. Application at this hour, she
imagined, would be unseasonable: it must be deferred till the morning,
which was yet at some distance.

Meanwhile to remain at her present post was equally useless and
dangerous. She endeavoured to stifle the conviction that some mortal
sickness had seized upon her own frame. Her anxieties of head and
stomach she was willing to impute to extraordinary fatigue and
watchfulness, and hoped that they would be dissipated by an hour's
unmolested repose. She formed the resolution of seeking her own chamber.

At this moment, however, the universal silence underwent a slight
interruption. The sound was familiar to her ears. It was a signal
frequently repeated at the midnight hour during this season of calamity.
It was the slow movement of a hearse, apparently passing along the
street in which the alley where Mr. Dudley resided terminated. At first
this sound had no other effect than to aggravate the dreariness of all
around her. Presently it occurred to her that this vehicle might be
disengaged. She conceived herself bound to see the last offices
performed for the deceased Mary. The sooner so irksome a duty was
discharged the better: every hour might augment her incapacity for
exertion. Should she be unable when the morning arrived to go as far as
the City-Hall, and give the necessary information, the most shocking
consequences would ensue. Whiston's house and her own were opposite each
other, and not connected with any on the same side. A narrow space
divided them, and her own chamber was within the sphere of the
contagion which would flow, in consequence of such neglect, from that of
her neighbour.

Influenced by these considerations she passed into the street, and
gained the corner of the alley just as the carriage, whose movements she
had heard, arrived at the same spot. It was accompanied by two men,
negroes, who listened to her tale with respect. Having already a burden
of this kind, they could not immediately comply with this request. They
promised that, having disposed of their present charge, they would
return forthwith, and be ready to execute her orders.

Happily one of these persons was known to her. At other seasons his
occupation was that of _wood-carter_, and as such he had performed some
services for Mr. Dudley. His temper was gentle and obliging. The
character of Constantia had been viewed by him with reverence, and his
kindness had relieved her from many painful offices. His old occupation
being laid aside for a time, he had betaken himself like many others of
his colour and rank, to the conveyance and burial of the dead.

At Constantia's request, he accompanied her to Whiston's house, and
promised to bring with him such assistance as would render her further
exertions and attendance unnecessary. Glad to be absolved from any new
task, she now retired to her own chamber. In spite of her distempered
frame, she presently sunk into a sweet sleep. She awoke not till the day
had made considerable progress, and found herself invigorated and
refreshed. On re-entering Whiston's house, she discovered that her
humble friend had faithfully performed his promise, the dead body having
disappeared. She deemed it unsafe, as well as unnecessary, to examine
the clothes and other property remaining; but, leaving every thing in
the condition in which it had been found, she fastened the windows and
doors, and thenceforth kept as distant from the house as possible.




CHAPTER VI.


Constantia had now leisure to ruminate upon her own condition. Every day
added to the devastation and confusion of the city. The most populous
streets were deserted and silent. The greater number of inhabitants had
fled; and those who remained were occupied with no cares but those which
related to their own safety. The labours of the artisan and the
speculations of the merchant were suspended. All shops but those of the
apothecaries were shut. No carriage but the hearse was seen, and this
was employed night and day in the removal of the dead. The customary
sources of subsistence were cut off. Those whose fortunes enabled them
to leave the city, but who had deferred till now their retreat, were
denied an asylum by the terror which pervaded the adjacent country, and
by the cruel prohibitions which the neighbouring towns and cities
thought it necessary to adopt. Those who lived by the fruits of their
daily labour were subjected, in this total inactivity, to the
alternative of starving, or of subsisting upon public charity.

The meditations of Constantia suggested no alternative but this. The
exactions of M'Crea had reduced her whole fortune to five dollars. This
would rapidly decay, and her utmost ingenuity could discover no means of
procuring a new supply. All the habits of their life had combined to
fill both her father and herself with aversion to the acceptance of
charity. Yet this avenue, opprobrious and disgustful as it was, afforded
the only means of escaping from the worst extremes of famine.

In this state of mind it was obvious to consider in what way the sum
remaining might be most usefully expended. Every species of provision
was not equally nutritious or equally cheap. Her mind, active in the
pursuit of knowledge and fertile of resources, had lately been engaged,
in discussing with her father the best means of retaining health in a
time of pestilence. On occasions, when the malignity of contagious
diseases has been most signal, some individuals have escaped. For their
safety they were doubtless indebted to some peculiarities in their
constitution or habits. Their diet, their dress, their kind and degree
of exercise, must somewhat have contributed to their exemption from the
common destiny. These, perhaps, could be ascertained, and when known it
was surely proper to conform to them.

In discussing these ideas, Mr. Dudley introduced the mention of a
Benedictine of Messina, who, during the prevalence of the plague in that
city, was incessantly engaged in administering assistance to those who
needed. Notwithstanding his perpetual hazards he retained perfect
health, and was living thirty years after this event. During this period
he fostered a tranquil, fearless, and benevolent spirit, and restricted
his diet to water and polenta. Spices, and meats, and liquors, and all
complexities of cookery, were utterly discarded.

These facts now occurred to Constantia's reflections with new vividness,
and led to interesting consequences. Polenta and hasty-pudding, or samp,
are preparations of the same substance,--a substance which she needed
not the experience of others to convince her was no less grateful than
nutritive. Indian meal was procurable at ninety cents per bushel. By
recollecting former experiments she knew that this quantity, with no
accompaniment but salt, would supply wholesome and plentiful food for
four months to one person[1]. The inference was palpable.

Three persons were now to be supplied with food, and this supply could
be furnished during four months at the trivial expense of three dollars.
This expedient was at once so uncommon and so desirable, as to be
regarded with temporary disbelief. She was inclined to suspect some
latent error in her calculation. That a sum thus applied should suffice
for the subsistence of a year, which in ordinary cases is expended in a
few days, was scarcely credible. The more closely, however, the subject
was examined, the more incontestably did this inference flow. The mode
of preparation was simple and easy, and productive of the fewest toils
and inconveniences. The attention of her Lucy was sufficient to this
end, and the drudgery of marketing was wholly precluded.

[1] See this useful fact explained and demonstrated in Count
Rumford's Essays.

She easily obtained the concurrence of her father, and the scheme was
found as practicable and beneficial as her fondest expectations had
predicted. Infallible security was thus provided against hunger. This
was the only care that was urgent and immediate. While they had food and
were exempt from disease, they could live, and were not without their
portion of comfort. Her hands were unemployed, but her mind was kept in
continual activity. To seclude herself as much as possible from others
was the best means of avoiding infection. Spectacles of misery which she
was unable to relieve would merely tend to harass her with useless
disquietudes and make her frame more accessible to disease. Her father's
instructions were sufficient to give her a competent acquaintance with
the Italian and French languages. His dreary hours were beguiled by this
employment, and her mind was furnished with a species of knowledge which
she hoped, in future, to make subservient to a more respectable and
plentiful subsistence than she had hitherto enjoyed.

Meanwhile the season advanced, and the havock which this fatal malady
produced increased with portentous rapidity. In alleys and narrow
streets, in which the houses were smaller, the inhabitants more numerous
and indigent, and the air pent up within unwholesome limits, it raged
with greatest violence. Few of Constantia's neighbours possessed the
means of removing from the danger. The inhabitants of this alley
consisted of three hundred persons: of these eight or ten experienced no
interruption of their health. Of the rest two hundred were destroyed in
the course of three weeks. Among so many victims it may be supposed that
this disease assumed every terrific and agonizing shape.

It was impossible for Constantia to shut out every token of a calamity
thus enormous and thus near. Night was the season usually selected for
the removal of the dead. The sound of wheels thus employed was
incessant. This, and the images with which it was sure to be
accompanied, bereaved her of repose. The shrieks and lamentations of
survivors, who could not be prevented from attending the remains of a
husband or child to the place of interment, frequently struck her
senses. Sometimes urged by a furious delirium, the sick would break from
their attendants, rush into the street, and expire on the pavement,
amidst frantic outcries and gestures. By these she was often roused from
imperfect sleep, and called to reflect upon the fate which impended over
her father and herself.

To preserve health in an atmosphere thus infected, and to ward off
terror and dismay in a scene of horrors thus hourly accumulating, was
impossible. Constantia found it vain to contend against the inroads of
sadness. Amidst so dreadful a mortality it was irrational to cherish the
hope that she or her father would escape. Her sensations, in no long
time, seemed to justify her apprehensions. Her appetite forsook her, her
strength failed, the thirst and lassitude of fever invaded her, and the
grave seemed to open for her reception.

Lucy was assailed by the same symptoms at the same time. Household
offices were unavoidably neglected. Mr. Dudley retained his health, but
he was able only to prepare his scanty food, and supply the cravings of
child with water from the well. His imagination marked him out for the
next victim. He could not be blind to the consequences of his own
indisposition at a period so critical. Disabled from contributing to
each other's assistance, destitute of medicine and food; and even of
water to quench their tormenting thirst, unvisited, unknown and
perishing in frightful solitude! These images had a tendency to
prostrate the mind, and generate or ripen the seeds of this fatal
malady, which, no doubt at this period of its progress every one had
imbibed.

Contrary to all his fears, he awoke each morning free from pain, though
not without an increase of debility. Abstinence from food, and the
liberal use of cold water, seemed to have a medicinal operation on the
sick. Their pulse gradually resumed its healthy tenor, their strength
and their appetite slowly returned, and in ten days they were able to
congratulate each other on their restoration.

I will not recount that series of disastrous thoughts which occupied the
mind of Constantia during this period. Her lingering and sleepless hours
were regarded by her as preludes to death. Though at so immature an age,
she had gained large experience of the evils which are allotted to man.
Death, which in her prosperous state was peculiarly abhorrent to her
feelings, was now disrobed of terror. As an entrance into scenes of
lightsome and imperishable being it was the goal of all her wishes: as a
passage to oblivion it was still desirable, since forgetfulness was
better than the life which she had hitherto led, and which, should her
existence be prolonged, it was likely that she could continue to lead.

These gloomy meditations were derived from the languors of her frame:
when these disappeared, her cheerfulness and fortitude revived. She
regarded with astonishment and delight the continuance of her father's
health and her own restoration. That trial seemed to have been safely
undergone, to which the life of every one was subject. The air, which
till now had been arid and sultry, was changed into cool and moist. The
pestilence had reached its utmost height, and now symptoms of remission
and decline began to appear. Its declension was more rapid than its
progress and every day added vigour to hope.

When her strength was somewhat retrieved, Constantia called to mind a
good woman who lived in her former neighbourhood, and from whom she had
received many proofs of artless affection. This woman's name was Sarah
Baxter. She lived within a small distance of Constantia's former
dwelling. The trade of her husband was that of a porter, and she
pursued, in addition to the care of a numerous family, the business of a
laundress. The superior knowledge and address of Constantia had enabled
her to be serviceable to this woman in certain painful and perplexing
circumstances.

This service was repaid with the utmost gratitude. Sarah regarded her
benefactress with a species of devotion. She could not endure to behold
one, whom every accent and gesture proved to have once enjoyed affluence
and dignity, performing any servile office. In spite of her own
multiplied engagements, she compelled Constantia to accept her
assistance on many occasions, and could scarcely be prevailed upon to
receive any compensation for her labour. Washing clothes was her trade,
and from this task she insisted on relieving her lovely patroness.

Constantia's change of dwelling produced much regret in the kind Sarah.
She did not allow it to make any change in their previous arrangements,
but punctually visited the Dudleys once a week, and carried home with
her whatever stood in need of ablution. When the prevalence of disease
disabled Constantia from paying her the usual wages, she would by no
means consent to be absolved from this task. Her earnestness on this
head was not to be eluded; and Constantia, in consenting that her work
should, for the present, be performed gratuitously, solaced herself with
the prospect of being able, by some future change of fortune, amply to
reward her.

Sarah's abode was distant from danger, and her fears were turbulent. She
was nevertheless punctual in her visits to the Dudleys, and anxious for
their safety. In case of their sickness, she had declared her
resolution to be their attendant and nurse. Suddenly, however, her
visits ceased. The day on which her usual visit was paid was the same
with that on which Constantia sickened, but her coming was expected in
vain. Her absence was, on some accounts, regarded with pleasure, as it
probably secured her from the danger connected with the office of a
nurse; but it added to Constantia's cares, inasmuch as her own sickness,
or that of some of her family, was the only cause of her detention.

To remove her doubts, the first use which Constantia made of her
recovered strength was to visit her laundress. Sarah's house was a
theatre of suffering. Her husband was the first of his family assailed
by the reigning disease. Two daughters, nearly grown to womanhood,
well-disposed and modest girls, the pride and support of their mother,
and who lived at service, returned home, sick, at the same time, and
died in a few days. Her husband had struggled for eleven days with his
disease, and was seized, just before Constantia's arrival, with the
pangs of death.

Baxter was endowed with great robustness and activity. This disease did
not vanquish him but with tedious and painful struggles. His muscular
force now exhausted itself in ghastly contortions, and the house
resounded with his ravings. Sarah's courage had yielded to so rapid a
succession of evils. Constantia found her shut up in a chamber, distant
from that of her dying husband, in a paroxysm of grief, and surrounded
by her younger children.

Constantia's entrance was like that of an angelic comforter. Sarah was
unqualified for any office but that of complaint. With great difficulty
she was made to communicate the knowledge of her situation. Her visitant
then passed into Baxter's apartment. She forced herself to endure this
tremendous scene long enough to discover that it was hastening to a
close. She left the house, and hastening to the proper office, engaged
the immediate attendance of a hearse. Before the lapse of an hour,
Baxter's lifeless remains were placed in a coffin, and conveyed away.

Constantia now exerted herself to comfort and encourage the survivors.
Her remonstrances incited Sarah to perform with alacrity the measures
which prudence dictates on these occasions. The house was purified by
the admission of air and the sprinkling of vinegar. Constantia applied
her own hand to these tasks, and set her humble friend an example of
forethought and activity. Sarah would not consent to part with her till
a late hour in the evening.

These exertions had like to have been fatally injurious to Constantia.
Her health was not sufficiently confirmed to sustain offices so arduous.
In the course of the night her fatigue terminated in fever. In the
present more salubrious state of the atmosphere, it assumed no malignant
symptoms, and shortly disappeared. During her indisposition she was
attended by Sarah, in whose honest bosom no sentiment was more lively
than gratitude. Constantia having promised to renew her visit the next
day, had been impatiently expected, and Sarah had come to her dwelling
in the evening, full of foreboding and anxiety, to ascertain the cause
of her delay. Having gained the bedside of her patroness, no
consideration could induce her to retire from it.

Constantia's curiosity was naturally excited as to the causes of
Baxter's disease. The simple-hearted Sarah was prolix and minute in the
history of her own affairs. No theme was more congenial to her temper
than that which was now proposed. In spite of redundance and obscurity
in the style of the narrative, Constantia found in it powerful
excitements of her sympathy. The tale, on its own account, as well as
from the connection of some of its incidents with a subsequent part of
these memoirs, is worthy to be here inserted. However foreign the
destiny of Monrose may at present appear to the story of the Dudleys,
there will hereafter be discovered an intimate connection between them.




CHAPTER VII.


Adjacent to the house occupied by Baxter was an antique brick tenement.
It was one of the first erections made by the followers of William Penn.
It had the honour to be used as the temporary residence of that
venerable person. Its moss-grown penthouse, crumbling walls, and ruinous
porch, made it an interesting and picturesque object. Notwithstanding
its age, it was still tenable.

This house was occupied, during the preceding months, by a Frenchman:
his dress and demeanour were respectable: his mode of life was frugal
almost to penuriousness, and his only companion was a daughter. The lady
seemed not much less than thirty years of age, but was of a small and
delicate frame. It was she that performed every household office. She
brought water from the pump, and provisions from the market. Their house
had no visitants, and was almost always closed. Duly as the morning
returned a venerable figure was seen issuing from his door, dressed in
the same style of tarnished splendour and old-fashioned preciseness. At
the dinner-hour he as regularly returned. For the rest of the day he was
invisible.

The habitations in this quarter are few and scattered. The pestilence
soon showed itself here, and the flight of most of the inhabitants
augmented its desolateness and dreariness. For some time, Monrose (that
was his name) made his usual appearance in the morning. At length the
neighbours remarked that he no longer came forth as usual. Baxter had a
notion that Frenchmen were exempt from this disease. He was, besides,
deeply and rancorously prejudiced against that nation. There will be no
difficulty in accounting for this, when it is known that he had been an
English grenadier at Dettingen and Minden. It must likewise be added,
that he was considerably timid, and had sickness in his own family.
Hence it was that the disappearance of Monrose excited in him no
inquisitiveness as to the cause. He did not even mention this
circumstance to others.

The lady was occasionally seen as usual in the street. There were always
remarkable peculiarities in her behaviour. In the midst of grave and
disconsolate looks, she never laid aside an air of solemn dignity. She
seemed to shrink from the observation of others, and her eyes were
always fixed upon the ground. One evening Baxter was passing the pump
while she was drawing water. The sadness which her looks betokened, and
a suspicion that her father might be sick, had a momentary effect upon
his feelings. He stopped and asked how her father was. She paid a polite
attention to his question and said something in French. This, and the
embarrassment of her air, convinced him that his words were not
understood. He said no more (what indeed could he say?) but passed on.

Two or three days after this, on returning in the evening to his family,
his wife expressed her surprise in not having seen Miss Monrose in the
street that day. She had not been at the pump, nor had she gone, as
usual, to market. This information gave him some disquiet; yet he could
form no resolution. As to entering the house and offering his aid, if
aid were needed, he had too much regard for his own safety, and too
little for that of a frog-eating Frenchman, to think seriously of that
expedient. His attention was speedily diverted by other objects, and
Monrose was, for the present, forgotten.

Baxter's profession was that of a porter. He was thrown out of
employment by the present state of things. The solicitude of the
guardians of the city was exerted on this occasion, not only in
opposing the progress of disease, and furnishing provisions to the
destitute, but in the preservation of property. For this end the number
of nightly watchmen was increased. Baxter entered himself in this
service. From nine till twelve o'clock at night it was his province to
occupy a certain post.

On this night he attended his post as usual: twelve o'clock arrived, and
he bent his steps homeward. It was necessary to pass by Monrose's door.
On approaching this house, the circumstance mentioned by his wife
recurred to him. Something like compassion was conjured up in his heart
by the figure of the lady, as he recollected to have lately seen it. It
was obvious to conclude that sickness was the cause of her seclusion.
The same, it might be, had confined her father. If this were true, how
deplorable might be their present condition! Without food, without
physician or friends, ignorant of the language of the country, and
thence unable to communicate their wants or solicit succour; fugitives
from their native land, neglected, solitary, and poor.

His heart was softened by these images. He stopped involuntarily when
opposite their door. He looked up at the house. The shutters were
closed, so that light, if it were within, was invisible. He stepped into
the porch, and put his eye to the key-hole. All was darksome and waste.
He listened, add imagined that he heard the aspirations of grief. The
sound was scarcely articulate, but had an electrical effect upon his
feelings. He retired to his home full of mournful reflections.

He was billing to do something for the relief of the sufferers, but
nothing could be done that night. Yet succour, if delayed till the
morning, might be ineffectual. But how, when the morning came, should he
proceed to effectuate his kind intentions? The guardians of the public
welfare at this crisis were distributed into those who counselled and
those who executed. A set of men, self-appointed to the generous office,
employed themselves in seeking out the destitute or sick, and imparting
relief. With this arrangement Baxter was acquainted. He was resolved to
carry tidings of what he had heard and seen to one of those persons
early the next day.

Baxter, after taking some refreshment, retired to rest. In no long time,
however, he was awakened by his wife, who desired him to notice a
certain glimmering on the ceiling. It seemed the feeble and flitting ray
of a distant and moving light, coming through the window. It did not
proceed from the street, for the chamber was lighted from the side, and
not from the front of the house. A lamp borne by a passenger, or the
attendants of a hearse, could not be discovered in this situation.
Besides, in the latter case, it would be accompanied by the sound of the
vehicle, and, probably by weeping and exclamations of despair. His
employment as the guardian of property, naturally suggested to him the
idea of robbery. He started from his bed, and went to the window.

His house stood at the distance of about fifty paces from that of
Monrose. There was annexed to the latter a small garden or yard, bounded
by a high wooden fence. Baxter's window overlooked this space. Before he
reached the window, the relative situation of the two habitations,
occurred to him. A conjecture was instantly formed that the glimmering
proceeded from this quarter. His eye, therefore, was immediately fixed
upon Monrose's back door. It caught a glimpse of a human figure passing
into the house through this door. The person had a candle in his hand.
This appeared by the light which streamed after him, and which was
perceived, though faintly, through a small window of the dwelling, after
the back-door was closed.

The person disappeared too quickly to allow him to say whether it was
male or female. This scrutiny confirmed rather than weakened the
apprehensions that first occurred. He reflected on the desolate and
helpless condition of this family. The father might be sick, and what
opposition could be made by the daughter to the stratagems of violence
of midnight plunderers? This was an evil which it was his duty, in an
extraordinary sense, to obviate. It is true, the hour of watching was
passed, and this was not the district assigned to him; but Baxter was,
on the whole, of a generous and intrepid spirit. In the present case,
therefore, he did not hesitate long in forming his resolution. He seized
a hanger that hung at his bedside, and which had hewn many an Hungarian
and French hussar to pieces. With this he descended to the street. He
cautiously approached Monrose's house. He listened at the door, but
heard nothing. The lower apartment, as he discovered through the
key-hole, was deserted and dark. These appearances could not be
accounted for. He was, as yet, unwilling to call or to knock. He was
solicitous to obtain some information by silent means, and without
alarming the persons within, who, if they were robbers, might thus be
put upon their guard, and enabled to escape. If none but the family were
there, they would not understand his signals, and might impute the
disturbance to the cause which he was desirous to obviate. What could he
do? Must he patiently wait till some incident should happen to regulate
his motions?

In this uncertainty, he bethought himself of going round to the back
part of the dwelling, and watching the door which had been closed. An
open space, filled with rubbish and weeds, adjoined the house and garden
on one side. Hither he repaired, and, raising his head above the fence,
at a point directly opposite the door, waited with considerable
impatience for some token or signal, by which he might be directed in
his choice of measures.

Human life abounds with mysterious appearances. A man perched on a fence
at midnight, mute and motionless, and gazing at a dark and dreary
dwelling, was an object calculated to rouse curiosity. When the muscular
form and rugged visage, scared and furrowed into something like
ferocity, were added,--when the nature of the calamity by which the city
was dispeopled was considered,--the motives to plunder, and the
insecurity of property arising from the pressure of new wants on the
poor, and the flight or disease of the rich, were attended to, an
observer would be apt to admit fearful conjectures.

We know not how long Baxter continued at this post. He remained here
because he could not, as he conceived, change it for a better. Before
his patience were exhausted, his attention was called by a noise within
the house. It proceeded from the lower room. The sound was that of
steps, but this was accompanied with other inexplicable tokens. The
kitchen door at length opened. The figure of Miss Monrose, pale,
emaciated, and haggard, presented itself. Within the door stood a
candle. It was placed on a chair within sight, and its rays streamed
directly against the face of Baxter, as it was reared above the top of
the fence. This illumination, faint as it was, bestowed a certain air of
wildness on the features which nature, and the sanguinary habits of a
soldier, had previously rendered, in an eminent degree, harsh and stern.
He was not aware of the danger of discovery in consequence of this
position of the candle. His attention was, for a few seconds, engrossed
by the object before him. At length he chanced to notice another object.

At a few yards' distance from the fence, and within it, some one
appeared to have been digging. An opening was made in the ground, but it
was shallow and irregular. The implement which seemed to have been used
was nothing more than a fire-shovel, for one of these he observed lying
near the spot. The lady had withdrawn from the door, though without
closing it. He had leisure, therefore, to attend to this new
circumstance, and to reflect upon the purpose for which this opening
might have been designed.

Death is familiar to the apprehensions of a soldier. Baxter had assisted
at the hasty interment of thousands, the victims of the sword or of
pestilence. Whether it was because this theatre of human calamity was
new to him, and death, in order to be viewed with his ancient unconcern,
must be accompanied in the ancient manner, with halberts and tents,
certain it is, that Baxter was irresolute and timid in every thing that
respected the yellow fever. The circumstances of the time suggested,
that this was a grave, to which some victim of this disease was to be
consigned. His teeth chattered when he reflected how near he might now
be to the source of infection: yet his curiosity retained him at his
post.

He fixed his eyes once more upon the door. In a short time the lady
again appeared at it. She was in a stooping posture, and appeared to be
dragging something along the floor. His blood ran cold at this
spectacle. His fear instantly figured to itself a corpse, livid and
contagious. Still he had no power to move. The lady's strength,
enfeebled as it was by grief, and perhaps by the absence of nourishment,
seemed scarcely adequate to the task which she had assigned herself.

Her burden, whatever it was, was closely wrapped in a sheet. She drew it
forward a few paces, then desisted, and seated herself on the ground
apparently to recruit her strength, and give vent to the agony of her
thoughts in sighs. Her tears were either exhausted or refused to flow,
for none were shed by her. Presently she resumed her undertaking.
Baxter's horror increased in proportion as she drew nearer to the spot
where he stood; and yet it seemed as if some fascination had forbidden
him to recede.

At length the burden was drawn to the side of the opening in the earth.
Here it seemed as if the mournful task was finished. She threw herself
once more upon the earth. Her senses seemed for a time to have forsaken
her. She sat buried in reverie, her eyes scarcely open, and fixed upon
the ground, and every feature set to the genuine expression of sorrow.
Some disorder, occasioned by the circumstance of dragging, now took
place in the vestment of what he had rightly predicted to be a dead
body. The veil by accident was drawn aside, and exhibited, to the
startled eye of Baxter, the pale and ghastly visage of the unhappy
Monrose.

This incident determined him. Every joint in his frame trembled, and he
hastily withdrew from the fence. His first motion in doing this produced
a noise by which the lady was alarmed; she suddenly threw her eyes
upward, and gained a full view of Baxter's extraordinary countenance,
just before it disappeared. She manifested her terror by a piercing
shriek. Baxter did not stay to mark her subsequent conduct, to confirm
or to dissipate her fears, but retired in confusion to his own house.

Hitherto his caution had availed him. He had carefully avoided all
employments and places from which he imagined imminent danger was to be
dreaded. Now, through his own inadvertency, he had rushed, as he
believed, into the jaws of the pest. His senses had not been assailed by
any noisome effluvia. This was no implausible ground for imagining that
his death had some other cause than the yellow fever. This circumstance
did not occur to Baxter. He had been told that Frenchmen were not
susceptible of this contagion. He had hitherto believed this assertion,
but now regarded it as having been fully confuted. He forgot that
Frenchmen were undoubtedly mortal, and that there was no impossibility
in Monrose's dying, even at this time, of a malady different from that
which prevailed.

Before morning he began to feel very unpleasant symptoms. He related his
late adventure to his wife. She endeavoured, by what argument her
slender ingenuity suggested, to quiet his apprehensions, but in vain. He
hourly grew worse, and as soon as it was light, dispatched his wife for
a physician. On interrogating this messenger, the physician obtained
information of last night's occurrences, and this being communicated to
one of the dispensers of the public charity, they proceeded, early in
the morning, to Monrose's house. It was closed as usual. They knocked
and called, but no one answered. They examined every avenue to the
dwelling, but none of them were accessible. They passed into the garden,
and observed, on the spot marked out by Baxter, a heap of earth. A very
slight exertion was sufficient to remove it, and discover the body of
the unfortunate exile beneath.

After unsuccessfully trying various expedients for entering the house,
they deemed themselves authorised to break the door. They entered,
ascended the staircase, and searched every apartment in the house, but
no human being was discoverable. The furniture was wretched and scanty,
but there was no proof that Monrose had fallen a victim to the reigning
disease. It was certain that the lady had disappeared. It was
inconceivable whither she had gone.

Baxter suffered a long period of sickness. The prevailing malady
appeared upon him in its severest form. His strength of constitution,
and the careful attendance of his wife, were insufficient to rescue him
from the grave. His case may be quoted as an example of the force of
imagination. He had probably already received, through the medium of the
air, or by contact of which he was not conscious, the seeds of this
disease. They might have perhaps have lain dormant, had not this panic
occurred to endow them with activity.




CHAPTER VIII.


Such were the facts circumstantially communicated by Sarah. They
afforded to Constantia a theme of ardent meditation. The similitude
between her own destiny and that of this unhappy exile could not fail to
be observed. Immersed in poverty, friendless, burdened with the
maintenance and nurture of her father, their circumstances were nearly
parallel. The catastrophe of her tale was the subject of endless but
unsatisfactory conjecture.

She had disappeared between the flight of Baxter and the dawn of day.
What path had she taken? Was she now alive? Was she still an inhabitant
of this city? Perhaps there was a coincidence of taste as well as
fortunes between them. The only friend that Constantia ever enjoyed,
congenial with her in principles, sex, and age, was at a distance that
forbade communication. She imagined that Ursula Monrose would prove
worthy of her love, and felt unspeakable regret at the improbability of
their ever meeting.

Meanwhile the dominion of cold began to be felt, and the contagious
fever entirely disappeared. The return of health was hailed with rapture
by all ranks of people. The streets were once more busy and frequented.
The sensation of present security seemed to shut out from all hearts the
memory of recent disasters. Public entertainments were thronged with
auditors. A new theatre had lately been constructed, and a company of
English Comedians had arrived during the prevalence of the malady. They
now began their exhibitions, and their audiences were overflowing.

Such is the motley and ambiguous condition of human society, such is the
complexity of all effects, from what cause soever they spring, that none
can tell whether this destructive pestilence was on, the whole,
productive of most pain or most pleasure. Those who had been sick and
had recovered found in this circumstance a source of exultation. Others
made haste by new marriages to supply the place of wives, husbands, and
children, whom the scarcely-extinguished pestilence had swept away.

Constantia, however, was permitted to take no share in the general
festivity. Such was the colour of her fate, that the yellow fever, by
affording her a respite from toil, supplying leisure for the acquisition
of a useful branch of knowledge, and leading her to the discovery of a
cheaper, more simple, and more wholesome method of subsistence, had been
friendly, instead of adverse to her happiness. Its disappearance,
instead of relieving her from suffering, was the signal for the approach
of new cares.

Of her ancient customers, some were dead, and others were slow in
resuming their ancient habitations, and their ordinary habits.
Meanwhile two wants were now created and were urgent. The season
demanded a supply of fuel, and her rent had accumulated beyond her power
to discharge. M'Crea no sooner returned from the country than he applied
to her for payment. Some proprietors, guided by humanity, had remitted
their dues, but M'Crea was not one of these. According to his own
representation, no man was poorer than himself, and the punctual payment
of all that was owing to him was no more than sufficient to afford him a
scanty subsistence.

He was aware of the indigence of the Dudleys, and was therefore
extremely importunate for payment, and could scarcely be prevailed upon
to allow them the interval of a day for the discovery of expedients.
This day was passed by Constantia in fruitless anxieties. The ensuing
evening had been fixed for a repetition of his visit. The hour arrived,
but her invention was exhausted in vain. M'Crea was punctual to the
minute. Constantia was allowed no option. She merely declared that the
money demanded she had not to give, nor could she foresee any period at
which her inability would be less than it then was.

These declarations were heard by her visitant with marks of unspeakable
vexation. He did not fail to expatiate on the equity of his demands, the
moderation and forbearance he had hitherto shown, notwithstanding the
extreme urgency of his own wants, and the inflexible rigour with which
he had been treated by _his_ creditors. This rhetoric was merely the
prelude to an intimation that he must avail himself of any lawful means,
by which he might gain possession of _his own_.

This insinuation was fully comprehended by Constantia, but it was heard
without any new emotions. Her knowledge of her landlord's character
taught her to expect but one consequence. He paused to observe what
effect would be produced by this indirect menace. She answered, without
any change of tone, that the loss of habitation and furniture, however
inconvenient at this season, must be patiently endured. If it were to be
prevented only by the payment of money, its prevention was impossible.

M'Crea renewed his regrets that there should be no other alternative.
The law sanctioned his claims, and justice to his family, which was
already large, and likely to increase, required that they should not be
relinquished; yet such was the mildness of his temper and his aversion
to proceed to this extremity, that he was willing to dispense with
immediate payment on two conditions. First, that they should leave his
house within a week, and secondly, that they should put into his hands
some trinket or movable, equal in value to the sum demanded, which
should be kept by him as a pledge.

This last hint suggested an expedient for obviating the present
distress. The lute with which Mr. Dudley was accustomed to solace his
solitude was, if possible, more essential to his happiness than shelter
or food. To his daughter it possessed little direct power to please. It
was inestimable merely for her father's sake. Its intrinsic value was at
least equal to the sum due, but to part with it was to bereave him of a
good which nothing else could supply. Besides, not being a popular and
saleable instrument, it would probably be contemptuously rejected by the
ignorance and avarice of M'Crea.

There was another article in her possession of some value in traffic,
and of a kind which M'Crea was far more likely to accept. It was the
miniature portrait of her friend, executed by a German artist, and set
in gold. This image was a precious though imperfect substitute for
sympathy and intercourse with the original. Habit had made this picture
a source of a species of idolatry. Its power over her sensations was
similar to that possessed by a beautiful Madonna over the heart of a
juvenile enthusiast. It was the mother of the only devotion which her
education had taught her to consider as beneficial or true.

She perceived the necessity of parting with it, on this occasion, with
the utmost clearness, but this necessity was thought upon with
indescribable repugnance. It seemed as if she had not thoroughly
conceived the extent of her calamity till now. It seemed as if she could
have endured the loss of eyes with less reluctance than the loss of this
inestimable relic. Bitter were the tears which she shed over it as she
took it from her bosom, and consigned it to those rapacious hands that
were stretched out to receive it. She derived some little consolation
from the promises of this man, that he would keep it safely till she was
able to redeem it.

The other condition--that of immediate removal from the house--seemed at
first sight impracticable. Some reflection, however, showed her that the
change might not only be possible but useful. Among other expedients for
diminishing expense, that of limiting her furniture and dwelling to the
cheapest standard had often occurred. She now remembered that the house
occupied by Monrose was tenantless; that its antiquity, its remote and
unpleasant situation, and its small dimensions, might induce M'Crea, to
whom it belonged, to let it at a much lower price than that which he now
exacted. M'Crea would have been better pleased if her choice had fallen
on a different house; but he had powerful though sordid reasons for
desiring the possession of this tenement. He assented therefore to her
proposal, provided her removal took place without delay.

In the present state of her funds this removal was impossible. Mere
shelter would not suffice during this inclement season. Without fuel,
neither cold could be excluded, nor hunger relieved. There was nothing
convertible into money but her lute. No sacrifice was more painful, but
an irresistible necessity demanded it.

Her interview with M'Crea took place while her father was absent from
the room. On his return she related what had happened, and urged the
necessity of parting with his favourite instrument. He listened to her
tale with a sigh. "Yes," said he, "do what thou wilt, my child. It is
unlikely that any one will purchase it. It is certain that no one will
give for it what I gave; but thou may'st try.

"It has been to me a faithful friend. I know not how I should have lived
without it. Its notes have cheered me with the sweet remembrances of old
times. It was, in some degree, a substitute for the eyes which I have
lost; but now let it go, and perform for me perhaps the dearest of its
services. It may help us to sustain the severities of this season."

There was no room for delay. She immediately set out in search of a
purchaser. Such a one was most likely to be found in the keeper of a
musical repository, who had lately arrived from Europe. She entertained
but slight hopes that an instrument scarcely known among her neighbours
would be bought at any price, however inconsiderable.

She found the keeper of the shop engaged in conversation with a lady,
whose person and face instantly arrested the attention of Constantia. A
less sagacious observer would have eyed the stranger with indifference.
But Constantia was ever busy in interpreting the language of features
and looks. Her sphere of observation had been narrow, but her habits of
examining, comparing, and deducing, had thoroughly exhausted that
sphere. These habits were eminently strong with relation to this class
of objects. She delighted to investigate the human countenance, and
treasured up numberless conclusions as to the coincidence between mental
and external qualities.

She had often been forcibly struck by forms that were accidentally seen,
and which abounded with this species of mute expression. They conveyed
at a single glance what could not be imparted by volumes. The features
and shape sunk, as it were, into perfect harmony with sentiments and
passions. Every atom of the frame was pregnant with significance. In
some, nothing was remarkable but this power of the outward figure to
exhibit the internal sentiments. In others, the intelligence thus
unveiled was remarkable for its heterogeneous or energetic qualities;
for its tendency to fill her heart with veneration or abhorrence, or to
involve her in endless perplexities.

The accuracy and vividness with which pictures of this kind presented
themselves to her imagination resembled the operations of a sixth sense.
It cannot be doubted, however, that much was owing to the enthusiastic
tenor of her own conceptions, and that her conviction of the truth of
the picture principally flowed from the distinctness and strength of its
hues.

The figure which she now examined was small, but of exquisite
proportions. Her complexion testified the influence of a torrid sun; but
the darkness veiled, without obscuring, the glowing tints of her cheek.
The shade was remarkably deep; but a deeper still was required to become
incompatible with beauty. Her features were irregular, but defects of
symmetry were amply supplied by eyes that anticipated speech and
positions which conveyed that to which language was inadequate.

It was not the chief tendency of her appearance to seduce or to melt.
Hers were the polished cheek and the mutability of muscle, which belong
to woman, but the genius conspicuous in her aspect was heroic and
contemplative. The female was absorbed, so to speak, in the rational
creature, and the emotions most apt to be excited in the gazer partook
less of love than of reverence.

Such is the portrait of this stranger, delineated by Constantia. I copy
it with greater willingness, because, if we substitute a nobler stature,
and a complexion less uniform and delicate, it is suited with the utmost
accuracy to herself. She was probably unconscious of this resemblance;
but this circumstance may be supposed to influence her in discovering
such attractive properties in a form thus vaguely seen. These
impressions, permanent and cogent as they were, were gained at a single
glance. The purpose which led her thither was too momentous to be long
excluded.

"Why," said the master of the shop, "this is lucky. Here is a lady who
has just been inquiring for an instrument of this kind. Perhaps the one
you have will suit her. If you will bring it to me, I will examine it,
and, if it is complete, will make a bargain with you." He then turned to
the lady who had first entered, and a short dialogue in French ensued
between them. The man repeated his assurances to Constantia, who,
promising to hasten back with the instrument, took her leave. The lute,
in its structure and ornaments, has rarely been surpassed. When
scrutinised by this artist it proved to be complete, and the price
demanded for it was readily given.

By this means the Dudleys were enabled to change their habitation, and
to supply themselves with fuel. To obviate future exigences, Constantia
betook herself once more to the needle. They persisted in the use of
their simple fare, and endeavoured to contract their wants, and
methodize their occupations, by a standard as rigid as possible. She
had not relinquished her design of adopting a new and more liberal
profession, but though, when indistinctly and generally considered, it
seemed easily effected, yet the first steps which it would be proper to
take did not clearly or readily suggest themselves. For the present she
was contented to pursue the beaten track, but was prepared to benefit by
any occasion that time might furnish, suitable to the execution of her
plan.




CHAPTER IX.


It may be asked if a woman of this character did not attract the notice
of the world. Her station, no less than her modes of thinking, excluded
her from the concourse of the opulent and the gay. She kept herself in
privacy: her engagements confined her to her own fireside, and her
neighbours enjoyed no means of penetrating through that obscurity in
which she wrapt herself. There were, no doubt, persons of her own sex
capable of estimating her worth, and who could have hastened to raise so
much merit from the indigence to which it was condemned. She might, at
least, have found associates and friends justly entitled to her
affection. But whether she were peculiarly unfortunate in this respect,
or whether it arose from a jealous and unbending spirit that would
remit none of its claims to respect, and was backward in its overtures
to kindness and intimacy, it so happened that her hours were, for a long
period, enlivened by no companion but her father and her faithful Lucy.
The humbleness of her dwelling, her plain garb, and the meanness of her
occupation, were no passports to the favour of the rich and vain. These,
added to her youth and beauty, frequently exposed her to insults, from
which, though productive for a time of mortification and distress, she,
for the most part, extricated herself by her spirited carriage and
presence of mind.

One incident of this kind it will be necessary to mention. One evening
her engagements carried her abroad. She had proposed to return
immediately, finding by experience the danger that was to be dreaded by
a woman young and unprotected. Something occurred that unavoidably
lengthened her stay, and she set out on her return at a late hour. One
of the other sex offered her his guardianship; but this she declined,
and proceeded homeward alone.

Her way lay through streets but little inhabited, and whose few
inhabitants were of the profligate class. She was conscious of the
inconveniences to which she was exposed, and therefore tripped along
with all possible haste. She had not gone far before she perceived,
through the dusk, two men standing near a porch before her. She had gone
too far to recede or change her course without exciting observation, and
she flattered herself that the persons would behave with decency.
Encouraged by these reflections, and somewhat hastening her pace, she
went on. As soon as she came opposite the place where they stood, one of
them threw himself round, and caught her arm, exclaiming, in a broad
tone, "Whither so fast, my love, at this time of night?" The other, at
the same time, threw his arm round her waist, crying out, "A pretty
prize, by G--: just in the nick of time."

They were huge and brawny fellows, in whose grasp her feeble strength
was annihilated. Their motions were so sudden that she had not time to
escape by flight. Her struggles merely furnished them with a subject of
laughter. He that held her waist proceeded to pollute her cheeks with
his kisses, and drew her into the porch. He tore her from the grasp of
him who first seized her, who seemed to think his property invaded, and
said, in a surly tone, "What now, Jemmy? Damn your heart, d'ye think
I'll be fobbed? Have done with your slabbering, Jemmy. First come, first
served," and seemed disposed to assert his claims by force.

To this brutality Constantia had nothing to oppose but fruitless
struggles and shrieks for help. Succour was, fortunately, at hand. Her
exclamations were heard by a person across the street, who instantly
ran, and with some difficulty disengaged her from the grasp of the
ruffians. He accompanied her the rest of the way, bestowed on her every
polite attention, and, though pressed to enter the house, declined the
invitation. She had no opportunity of examining the appearance of her
new friend: this the darkness of the night, and her own panic,
prevented.

Next day a person called upon her whom she instantly recognized to be
her late protector. He came with some message from his sister. His
manners were simple and unostentatious and breathed the genuine spirit
of civility. Having performed his commission, and once more received the
thanks which she poured forth with peculiar warmth for his last night's
interposition, he took his leave.

The name of this man was Balfour. He was middle-aged, of a figure
neither elegant nor ungainly, and an aspect that was mild and placid,
but betrayed few marks of intelligence. He was an adventurer from
Scotland, whom a strict adherence to the maxims of trade had rendered
opulent. He was governed by the principles of mercantile integrity in
all his dealings, and was affable and kind, without being generous, in
his treatment of inferiors. He was a stranger to violent emotions of any
kind, and his intellectual acquisitions were limited to his own
profession.

His demeanour was tranquil and uniform. He was sparing of words, and
these were uttered in the softest manner. In all his transactions he wad
sedate and considerate. In his dress and mode of living there were no
appearances of parsimony, but there were, likewise, as few traces of
profusion.

His sister had shared in his prosperity. As soon as his affairs would
permit, he sent for her to Scotland, where she had lived in a state
little removed from penury, and had for some years been vested with the
superintendence of his household. There was a considerable resemblance
between them in person and character. Her profession, or those arts in
which her situation had compelled her to acquire skill, had not an equal
tendency to enlarge the mind as those of her brother, but the views of
each were limited to one set of objects. His superiority was owing, not
to any inherent difference, but to accident.

Balfour's life had been a model of chasteness and regularity,--though
this was owing more to constitutional coldness, and a frugal spirit,
than to virtuous forbearance; but, in his schemes for the future, he did
not exclude the circumstance of marriage. Having attained a situation
secure as the nature of human affairs will admit from the chances of
poverty, the way was sufficiently prepared for matrimony. His thoughts
had been for some time employed in the selection of a suitable
companion, when this rencounter happened with Miss Dudley.

Balfour was not destitute of those feelings which are called into play
by the sight of youth and beauty in distress. This incident was not
speedily forgotten. The emotions produced by it were new to him. He
reviewed them oftener, and with more complacency, than any which he had
before experienced. They afforded him so much satisfaction, that, in
order to preserve them undiminished, he resolved to repeat his visit.
Constantia treated him as one from whom she had received a considerable
benefit. Her sweetness and gentleness were uniform, and Balfour found
that her humble roof promised him more happiness than his own fireside,
or the society of his professional brethren.

He could not overlook, in the course of such reflections as these, the
question relative to marriage, and speedily determined to solicit the
honour of her hand. He had not decided without his usual foresight and
deliberation; nor had he been wanting in the accuracy of his
observations and inquiries. Those qualifications, indeed, which were of
chief value in his eyes, lay upon the surface. He was no judge of her
intellectual character, or of the loftiness of her morality. Not even
the graces of person, or features or manners, attracted much of his
attention. He remarked her admirable economy of time, and money, and
labour, the simplicity of her dress, her evenness of temper, and her
love of seclusion. These ware essential requisites of a wife, in his
apprehension. The insignificance of his own birth, the lowness of his
original fortune, and the efficacy of industry and temperance to confer
and maintain wealth, had taught him indifference as to birth or fortune
in his spouse. His moderate desires in this respect were gratified, and
he was anxious only for a partner that would aid him in preserving
rather than in enlarging his property. He esteemed himself eminently
fortunate in meeting with one in whom every matrimonial qualification
concentred.

He was not deficient in modesty, but he fancied that, on this occasion,
there was no possibility of miscarriage. He held her capacity in deep
veneration, but this circumstance rendered him more secure of success.
He conceived this union to be even more eligible with regard to her than
to himself, and confided in the rectitude of her understanding for a
decision favourable to his wishes.

Before any express declaration was made, Constantia easily predicted the
event from the frequency of his visits; and the attentiveness of his
manners. It was no difficult task to ascertain this man's character. Her
modes of thinking were, in few respects, similar to those of her lover.
She was eager to investigate, in the first place, the attributes of his
mind. His professional and household maxims were not of inconsiderable
importance, but they were subordinate considerations. In the poverty of
his discourse and ideas she quickly found reasons for determining her
conduct.

Marriage she had but little considered, as it is in itself. What are the
genuine principles of that relation, and what conduct with respect to it
is prescribed to rational beings by their duty, she had not hitherto
investigated. But she was not backward to inquire what are the precepts
of duty in her own particular case. She knew herself to be young; she
was sensible of the daily enlargement of her knowledge: every day
contributed to rectify some error, or confirm some truth. These benefits
she owed to her situation, which, whatever were its evils, gave her as
much freedom from restraint as is consistent with the state of human
affairs. Her poverty fettered her exertions, and circumscribed her
pleasures. Poverty, therefore, was an evil, and the reverse of poverty
was to be desired. But riches were not barren of constraint, and its
advantages might be purchased at too dear a rate.

Allowing that the wife is enriched by marriage, how humiliating were the
conditions annexed to it in the present case! The company of one with
whom we have no sympathy, nor sentiments in common, is, of all species
of solitude, the most loathsome and dreary. The nuptial life is attended
with peculiar aggravations, since the tie is infrangible, and the choice
of a more suitable companion, if such a one should offer, is for ever
precluded. The hardships of wealth are not incompensated by some
benefits; but these benefits, false and hollow as they are, cannot be
obtained by marriage. Her acceptance of Balfour would merely aggravate
her indigence.

Now she was at least mistress of the product of her own labour. Her
tasks were toilsome, but the profits, though slender, were sure, and
she administered her little property in what manner she pleased.
Marriage would annihilate this, power. Henceforth she would he bereft
even of personal freedom. So far from possessing property, she herself
would become the property of another.

She was not unaware of the consequences flowing from differences of
capacity, and that power, to whomsoever legally granted, will be
exercised by the most addressful; but she derived no encouragement from
these considerations. She would not stoop to gain her end by the hateful
arts of the sycophant, and was too wise to place an unbounded reliance
on the influence of truth. The character, likewise, of this man,
sufficiently exempted him from either of those influences.

She did not forget the nature of the altar-vows. To abdicate the use of
her own understanding was scarcely justifiable in any case; but to vow
an affection that was not felt, and could not be compelled, and to
promise obedience to one whose judgment was glaringly defective, were
acts atrociously criminal. Education, besides, had created in her an
insurmountable abhorrence of admitting to conjugal privileges the man
who had no claim upon her love. It could not be denied that a state of
abundant accommodation was better than the contrary; but this
consideration, though, in the most rational estimate, of some weight,
she was not so depraved and effeminate as to allow to overweigh the
opposite evils. Homely liberty was better than splendid servitude.

Her resolution was easily formed, but there were certain impediments in
the way of its execution. These chiefly arose from deference to the
opinion, and compassion for the infirmities of her father. He assumed no
control over her actions. His reflections in the present case were
rather understood than expressed. When uttered, it was with the
mildness of equality, and the modesty of persuasion. It was this
circumstance that conferred upon them all their force. His decision on
so delicate a topic was not wanting in sagacity and moderation; but, as
a man, he had his portion of defects, and his frame was enfeebled by
disease and care; yet he set no higher value on the ease and
independence of his former condition than any man of like experience. He
could not endure to exist on the fruits of his daughter's labour. He
ascribed her decision to a spirit of excessive refinement, and was, of
course, disposed to give little quarter to maiden scruples. They were
phantoms, he believed, which experience would dispel. His morality,
besides, was of a much more flexible kind; and the marriage vows were,
in his opinion, formal and unmeaning, and neither in themselves, nor in
the opinion of the world, accompanied with any rigorous obligation. He
drew more favourable omens from the known capacity of his daughter, and
the flexibility of her lover.

She demanded his opinion and advice. She listened to his reasonings, and
revolved them with candour and impartiality. She stated her objections
with simplicity; but the difference of age and sex was sufficient to
preclude agreement. Arguments were of no use but to prolong the debate;
but, happily, the magnanimity of Mr. Dudley would admit of no sacrifice.
Her opinions, it is true, were erroneous; but he was willing that she
should regulate her conduct by her own conceptions of right, and not by
those of another. To refuse Balfour's offers was an evil, but an evil
inexpressibly exceeded by that of accepting them contrary to her own
sense of propriety.

Difficulties, likewise, arose from the consideration of what was due to
the man who had already benefited her, and who, in this act, intended to
confer upon her further benefit. These, though the source of some
embarrassment, were not sufficient to shake her resolution. Balfour
could not understand her principal objections. They were of a size
altogether disproportioned to his capacity. Her moral speculations were
quite beyond the sphere of his reflections. She could not expatiate,
without a breach of civility, on the disparity of their minds, and yet
this was the only or principal ground on which she had erected her
scruples.

Her father loved her too well not to be desirous of relieving her from a
painful task, though undertaken without necessity, and contrary to his
opinion. "Refer him to me," said he; "I will make the best of the
matter, and render your refusal as palatable as possible; but do you
authorize me to make it absolute, and without appeal."

"My dear father! how good you are! but that shall be my province. If I
err, let the consequences of my mistake be confined to myself. It would
be cruel indeed to make you the instrument in a transaction which your
judgment disapproves. My reluctance was a weak and foolish thing.
Strange, indeed, if the purity of my motives will not bear me out on
this, as it has done on many more arduous occasions."

"Well, be it so; that is best I believe. Ten to one but I, with my want
of eyes would blunder, while yours will be of no small use in a contest
with a lover. They will serve you to watch the transitions in his placid
physiognomy, and overpower his discontents."

She was aware of the inconveniences to which this resolution would
subject her; but since they were unavoidable, she armed herself with the
requisite patience. Her apprehensions were not without reason. More than
one conference was necessary to convince him of her meaning, and in
order to effect her purpose she was obliged to behave with so much
explicitness as to hazard giving him offence. This affair was
productive of no small vexation. He had put too much faith in the
validity of his pretensions, and the benefits of perseverance, to be
easily shaken off.

This decision was not borne by him with as much patience as she wished.
He deemed himself unjustly treated, and his resentment exceeded those
bounds of moderation which he prescribed to himself on all other
occasions. From his anger, however, there was not much to be dreaded;
but, unfortunately, his sister partook of his indignation and indulged
her petulance, which was enforced by every gossiping and tattling
propensity, to the irreparable disadvantage of Constantia.

She owed her support to her needle. She was dependent therefore on the
caprice of customers. This caprice was swayable by every breath, and
paid a merely subordinate regard, in the choice of workwomen, to the
circumstances of skill, cheapness and diligence. In consequence of
this, her usual sources of subsistence began to fail.

Indigence, as well as wealth, is comparative. He indeed must be
wretched, whose food, clothing, and shelter, are limited, both in kind
and quantity, by the standard of mere necessity; who, in the choice of
food, for example, is governed by no consideration but its cheapness,
and its capacity to sustain nature. Yet to this degree of wretchedness
was Miss Dudley reduced.

As her means of subsistence began to decay, she reflected on the change
of employment that might become necessary. She was mistress of no
lucrative art but that which now threatened to be useless. There was but
one avenue through which she could hope to escape from the pressure of
absolute want. This she regarded with an aversion that nothing but
extreme necessity, and the failure of every other expedient, would be
able to subdue. This was the hiring herself as a servant. Even that
could not answer all her purposes. If a subsistence were provided by it
for herself, whither should her father and her Lucy betake themselves
for support?

Hitherto her labour had been sufficient to shut out famine and the cold.
It is true she had been cut off from all the direct means of personal or
mental gratification; but her constitution had exempted her from the
insalutary effects of sedentary application. She could not tell how long
she could enjoy this exemption, but it was absurd to anticipate those
evils which might never arrive. Meanwhile, her situation was not
destitute of comfort. The indirect means of intellectual improvement in
conversation and reflection, the inexpensive amusement of singing, and,
above all, the consciousness of performing her duty, and maintaining her
independence inviolate, were still in her possession. Her lodging was
humble, and her fare frugal, but these temperance and a due regard to
the use of money would require from the most opulent.

Now retrenchments must be made even from this penurious provision. Her
exertions might somewhat defer, but could not prevent, the ruin of her
unhappy family. Their landlord was a severe exacter of his dues. The day
of quarterly payment was past, and he had not failed in his usual
punctuality. She was unable to satisfy his demands, and Mr. Dudley was
officially informed, that unless payment was made before a day fixed,
resort would be had to the law, in that case made and provided.

This seemed to be the completion of their misfortunes. It was not enough
to soften the implacability of their landlord. A respite might possibly
be obtained from this harsh sentence. Entreaties might prevail upon him
to allow of their remaining under this roof for some time longer; but
shelter at this inclement season was not enough. Without fire they must
perish with the cold; and fuel could be procured only for money, of
which the last shilling was expended. Food was no less indispensable;
and, their credit being gone, not a loaf could be extorted from the
avarice of the bakers in the neighbourhood.

The sensations produced by this accumulation of distress may be more
easily conceived than described. Mr. Dudley sunk into despair, when Lucy
informed him that the billet of wood she was putting on the fire was the
last. "Well," said he, "the game is up. Where is my daughter?" The
answer was, that she was up-stairs.

"Why, there she has been this hour. Tell her to come down and warm
herself. She must needs be cold, and here is a cheerful blaze. I feel it
myself. Like the lightning that precedes death, it beams thus brightly,
though in a few moments it will be extinguished forever. Let my darling
come and partake of its comforts before they expire."

Constantia had retired in order to review her situation and devise some
expedients that might alleviate it. It was a sore extremity to which she
was reduced. Things had come to a desperate pass, and the remedy
required must be no less desperate. It was impossible to see her father
perish. She herself would have died before she would have condescended
to beg. It was not worth prolonging a life which must subsist upon alms.
She would have wandered into the fields at dusk, have seated herself
upon an unfrequented bank, and serenely waited the approach of that
death which the rigours of the season would have rendered sure. But as
it was, it became her to act in a very different manner.

During her father's prosperity, some mercantile intercourse had taken
place between him and a merchant of this city. The latter on some
occasion had spent a few nights at her father's house. She was greatly
charmed with the humanity that shone forth in his conversation and
behaviour. From that time to this all intercourse had ceased. She was
acquainted with the place of his abode, and knew him to be affluent. To
him she determined to apply as a suppliant in behalf of her father. She
did not inform Mr. Dudley of this intention, conceiving it best to wait
till the event had been ascertained, for fear of exciting fallacious
expectations. She was further deterred by the apprehension of awakening
his pride, and bringing on herself an absolute prohibition.

She arrived at the door of Mr. Melbourne's house, and inquiring for the
master of it, was informed that he had gone out of town, and was not
expected to return for a week.

Her scheme, which was by no means unplausible, was thus completely
frustrated. There was but one other resource, on which she had already
deliberated, and to which she had determined to apply if that should
fail. That was to claim assistance from the superintendants of the poor.
She was employed in considering to which of them, and in what manner she
should make her application, when she turned the corner of Lombard and
Second Streets. That had scarcely been done, when casting her eyes
mournfully round her, she caught a glimpse of a person whom she
instantly recognized passing into the market-place. She followed him
with quick steps, and on a second examination found that she had not
been mistaken. This was no other than Thomas Craig, to whose malignity
and cunning all her misfortunes were imputable.

She was at first uncertain what use to make of this discovery. She
followed him instinctively, and saw him at length enter the Indian Queen
Tavern. Here she stopped. She entertained a confused conception that
some beneficial consequences might be extracted from this event. In the
present hurry of her thoughts she could form no satisfactory conclusion;
but it instantly occurred to her that it would at least be proper to
ascertain the place of his abode. She stept into the inn, and made the
suitable inquiries. She was informed that the gentleman had come from
Baltimore a month before, and had since resided at that house. How soon
he meant to leave the city her informant was unable to tell.

Having gained this intelligence, she returned home, and once more shut
herself in her chamber to meditate on this new posture of affairs.




CHAPTER X.


Craig was indebted to her father. He had defrauded him by the most
atrocious and illicit arts. On either account he was liable to
prosecution; but her heart rejected the thought of being the author of
injury to any man. The dread of punishment, however, might induce him to
refund, uncoercively, the whole or some part of the stolen property.
Money was at this moment necessary to existence, and she conceived
herself justly entitled to that of which her father had been
perfidiously despoiled.

But the law was formal and circuitous. Money itself was necessary to
purchase its assistance. Besides, it could not act with unseen virtue
and instantaneous celerity. The co-operation of advocates and officers
was required. They must be visited, and harangued, and importuned. Was
she adequate to the task? Would the energy of her mind supply the place
of experience, and with a sort of miraculous efficacy, afford her the
knowledge of official processes and dues? As little on this occasion
could be expected from her father as from her. He was infirm and blind.
The spirit that animated his former days was flown. His heart's blood
was chilled by the rigours of his fortune. He had discarded his
indignation and his enmities, and together with them, hope itself had
perished in his bosom. He waited in tranquil despair, for that stroke
which would deliver him from life, and all the woes that it inherits.

But these considerations were superfluous. It was enough that justice
must be bought, and that she had not the equivalent. Legal proceedings
are encumbered with delay, and her necessities were urgent. Succour, if
withheld till the morrow, would be useless. Hunger and cold would not
be trifled with. What resource was there left in this her uttermost
distress? Must she yield, in imitation of her father, to the cowardly
suggestions of despair?

Craig might be rich: his coffers might be stuffed with thousands. All
that he had, according to the principles of social equity, was hers; yet
he, to whom nothing belonged, rioted in superfluity, while she, the
rightful claimant, was driven to the point of utmost need. The proper
instrument of her restoration was law, but its arm was powerless, for
she had not the means of bribing it into activity. But was law the only
instrument?

Craig perhaps was accessible. Might she not, with propriety, demand an
interview, and lay before him the consequences of his baseness? He was
not divested of the last remains of humanity. It was impossible that he
should not relent at the picture of those distresses of which he was the
author. Menaces of legal prosecution she meant not to use, because she
was unalterably resolved against that remedy. She confided in the
efficacy of her pleadings to awaken his justice. This interview she was
determined immediately to seek. She was aware that by some accident her
purpose might be frustrated. Access to his person might, for the
present, be impossible, or might be denied. It was proper, therefore to
write him a letter, which might be substituted in place of an interview.
It behoved her to be expeditious, for the light was failing, and her
strength was nearly exhausted by the hurry of her spirits. Her fingers
likewise were benumbed with the cold. She performed her task, under
these disadvantages, with much difficulty. This was the purport of her
letter:--

     "THOMAS CRAIG,

     "An hour ago I was in Second Street, and saw you. I followed you
     till you entered the Indian Queen Tavern. Knowing where you are, I
     am now preparing to demand an interview. I may he disappointed in
     this hope, and therefore write you this.

     "I do not come to upbraid you, to call you to a legal, or any other
     account for your actions. I presume not to weigh your merits. The
     God of equity be your judge. May he be as merciful in the hour of
     retribution as I am disposed to be!

     "It is only to inform you that my father is on the point of
     perishing with want. You know who it was that reduced him to this
     condition. I persuade myself I shall not appeal to your justice in
     vain. Learn of this justice to afford him instant succour.

     "You know who it was that took you in, an houseless wanderer,
     protected and fostered your youth, and shared with you his
     confidence and his fortune. It is he who now, blind and indigent,
     is threatened by an inexorable landlord to be thrust into the
     street, and who is, at this moment without fire and without bread.

     "He once did you some little service; now he looks to be
     compensated. All the retribution he asks is to be saved from
     perishing. Surely you will not spurn at his claims. Thomas Craig
     has done nothing that shows him deaf to the cries of distress. He
     would relieve a dog from such sufferings.

     "Forget that you have known my father in any character but that of
     a supplicant for bread. I promise you that on this condition I also
     will forget it. If you are so far just, you have nothing to fear.
     Your property and reputation shall both be safe. My father knows
     not of your being in this city. His enmities are extinct, and if
     you comply with this request, he shall know you only as a
     benefactor.

     "C. DUDLEY."

Having finished and folded this epistle, she once more returned to the
tavern. A waiter informed her that Craig had lately been in, and was now
gone out to spend the evening. "Whither had he gone?" she asked.

"How was he to know where gentlemen eat their suppers? Did she take him
for a witch? What, in God's name, did she want with him at that hour?
Could she not wait, at least, till he had done his supper? He warranted
her pretty face would bring him home time enough."

Constantia was not disconcerted at the address. She knew that females
are subjected, through their own ignorance and cowardice, to a thousand
mortifications. She set its true value on base and low-minded treatment.
She disdained to notice this ribaldry, but turned away from the servant
to meditate on this disappointment.

A few moments after, a young fellow smartly dressed entered the
apartment. He was immediately addressed by the other, who said to him,
"Well, Tom, where's your master: there's a lady wants him," (pointing to
Constantia, and laying a grinning emphasis on the word "lady".) She
turned to the new-comer: "Friend, are you Mr. Craig's servant?"

The fellow seemed somewhat irritated at the bluntness of her
interrogatory. The appellation of servant sat uneasily, perhaps, on his
pride, especially as coming from a person of her appearance. He put on
an air of familiar ridicule, and surveyed her in silence. She resumed,
in an authoritative tone:--"Where does Mr. Craig spend this evening? I
have business with him of the highest importance, and that will not bear
delay. I must see him this night." He seemed preparing to make some
impertinent answer, but she anticipated it: "You had better answer me
with decency. If you do not, your master shall hear of it."

This menace was not ineffectual. He began in perceive himself in the
wrong, and surlily muttered, "Why, if you must know, he is gone to Mr.
Ormond's." And where lived Mr. Ormond? In Arch Street; he mentioned the
number on her questioning him to that effect.

Being furnished with this information, she left them. Her project was
not to be thwarted by slight impediments, and she forthwith proceeded to
Ormond's dwelling. "Who was this Ormond?" she inquired of herself as she
went along: "whence originated and of what nature is the connection
between him and Craig? Are they united by unison of designs and sympathy
of character, or is this stranger a new subject on whom Craig is
practising his arts? The last supposition is not impossible. Is it not
my duty to disconcert his machinations and save a new victim from his
treachery? But I ought to be sure before I act. He may now be honest, or
tending to honesty, and my interference may cast him backward, or
impede his progress."

The house to which she had been directed was spacious and magnificent.
She was answered by a servant, whose uniform was extremely singular and
fanciful, whose features and accents bespoke him to be English, with a
politeness to which she knew that the simplicity of her dress gave her
no title. Craig, he told her, was in the drawing-room above stairs. He
offered to carry him any message, and ushered her, meanwhile, into a
parlour. She was surprised at the splendour of the room. The ceiling was
painted with a gay design, the walls stuccoed in relief, and the floor
covered with a Persian carpet, with suitable accompaniments of mirrors,
tables, and sofas.

Craig had been seated at the window above. His suspicions were ever on
the watch. He suddenly espied a figure and face on the opposite side of
the street, which an alteration of garb and the improvements of time
could not conceal from his knowledge. He was startled at this incident,
without knowing the extent of its consequences. He saw her cross the way
opposite this house, and immediately after heard the bell ring. Still he
was not aware that he himself was the object of this visit, and waited
with some degree of impatience for the issue of this adventure.

Presently he was summoned to a person below, who wished to see him. The
servant shut the door as soon as he had delivered the message and
retired.

Craig was thrown into considerable perplexity. It was seldom that he was
wanting in presence of mind and dexterity, but the unexpectedness of
this incident made him pause. He had not forgotten the awful charms of
his summoner. He shrunk at the imagination of her rebukes. What purpose
could be answered by admitting her? It was undoubtedly safest to keep
at a distance; but what excuse should be given for refusing this
interview? He was roused from his reverie by a second and more urgent
summons. The person could not conveniently wait; her business was of the
utmost moment, and would detain him but a few minutes.

The anxiety which was thus expressed to see him only augmented his
solicitude to remain invisible. He had papers before him, which he had
been employed in examining. This suggested an excuse--"Tell her that I
am engaged just now, and cannot possibly attend to her. Let her leave
her business. If she has any message, you may bring it to me."

It was plain to Constantia that Craig suspected the purpose of her
visit. This might have come to his knowledge by means impossible for her
to divine. She now perceived the wisdom of the precaution she had taken.
She gave her letter to the servant with this message:--"Tell him I
shall wait here for an answer, and continue to wait till I receive one."

Her mind was powerfully affected by the criticalness of her situation.
She had gone thus far, and saw the necessity of persisting to the end.
The goal was within view, and she formed a sort of desperate
determination not to relinquish the pursuit. She could not overlook the
possibility that he might return no answer, or return an unsatisfactory
one. In either case, she was resolved to remain in the house till driven
from it by violence. What other resolution could she form? To return to
her desolate home, pennyless, was an idea not to be endured.

The letter was received, and perused. His conscience was touched, but
compunction was a guest whose importunities he had acquired a peculiar
facility of eluding. Here was a liberal offer. A price was set upon his
impunity. A small sum, perhaps, would secure him from all future
molestation.--"She spoke, to-be-sure, in a damned high tone. 'Twas a
pity that the old man should be hungry before supper-time. Blind too!
Harder still, when he cannot find his way to his mouth. Rent unpaid, and
a flinty-hearted landlord. A pretty pickle, to-be-sure. Instant payment,
she says. Won't part without it. Must come down with the stuff. I know
this girl. When her heart is once set upon a thing, all the devils will
not turn her out of her way. She promises silence. I can't pretend to
bargain with her. I'd as lief be ducked, as meet her face to face. I
know she'll do what she promises: that was always her grand failing. How
the little witch talks! Just the dreamer she ever was! Justice!
Compassion! Stupid fool! One would think she'd learned something of the
world by this time."

He took out his pocket-book. Among the notes it contained the lowest was
fifty dollars. This was too much, yet there was no alternative;
something must be given. She had detected his abode, and he knew it was
in the power of the Dudleys to ruin his reputation, and obstruct his
present schemes. It was probable that, if they should exert themselves,
their cause would find advocates and patrons. Still the gratuitous gift
of fifty dollars sat uneasily upon his avarice. One idea occurred to
reconcile him to the gift. There was a method he conceived of procuring
the repayment of it with interest: he enclosed the note in a blank piece
of paper, and sent it to her.

She received the paper, and opened it with trembling fingers: when she
saw what were its contents, her feelings amounted to rapture. A sum like
this was affluence to her in her present condition; at least it would
purchase present comfort and security. Her heart glowed with exultation,
and she seemed to tread with the lightness of air as she hied homeward.
The languor of a long fast, the numbness of the cold, were forgotten.
It is worthy of remark how much of human accommodation was comprised
within this small compass; and how sudden was this transition from the
verge of destruction to the summit of security.

Her first business was to call upon her landlord, and pay him his
demand. On her return she discharged the little debts she had been
obliged to contract, and purchased what was immediately necessary. Wood
she could borrow from her next neighbour, and this she was willing to
do, now that she had the prospect of repaying it.

ORMOND,

OR THE

SECRET WITNESS




CHAPTER I.


On leaving Mr. Ormond's house, Constantia was met by that gentleman. He
saw her as she came out, and was charmed with the simplicity of her
appearance. On entering, he interrogated the servant as to the business
that brought her thither.

"So," said he, as he entered the drawing-room, where Craig was seated,
"you have had a visitant. She came, it seems, on a pressing occasion,
and would be put off with nothing but a letter."

Craig had not expected this address, but it only precipitated the
execution of a design that he had formed. Being aware of this or
similar accidents, he had constructed and related on a previous occasion
to Ormond a story suitable to his purpose.

"Ay," said he, in a tone of affected compassion, "it is a sad affair
enough. I am sorry it is not in my power to help the poor girl. She is
wrong in imputing her father's misfortunes to me, but I know the source
of her mistake. Would to heaven it was in my flower to repair the wrongs
they have suffered not from me, but from one whose relationship is a
disgrace to me."

"Perhaps," replied the other, "you are willing to explain this affair."

"Yes, I wish to explain it. I was afraid of some such accident as this.
An explanation is due to my character. I have already told you my story.
I mentioned to you a brother of mine. There is scarcely thirteen months
difference in our ages. There is a strong resemblance between him and
me in our exterior, though I hope there is none at all in our minds.
This brother was a partner of a gentleman, the father of this girl, at
New York. He was a long time nothing better than an apprentice to Mr.
Dudley, but he advanced so much in the good graces of his master, that
he finally took him into partnership. I did not know till I arrived on
the continent the whole of his misconduct. It appears that he embezzled
the property of the house, and fled away with it, and the consequence
was, that his quondam master was ruined. I am often mistaken for my
brother, to my no small inconvenience: but all this I told you formerly.
See what a letter I just now received from this girl."

Craig was one of the most plausible of men. His character was a standing
proof of the vanity of physiognomy. There were few men who could refuse
their confidence to his open and ingenuous aspect. To this
circumstance, perhaps, he owed his ruin. His temptations to deceive
were stronger than what are incident to most other men. Deception was so
easy a task, that the difficulty lay, not in infusing false opinions
respecting him, but in preventing them from being spontaneously imbibed.
He contracted habits of imposture imperceptibly. In proportion as he
deviated from the practice of truth, he discerned the necessity of
extending and systematizing his efforts, and of augmenting the original
benignity and attractiveness of his looks, by studied additions. The
further he proceeded, the more difficult it was to return. Experience
and habit added daily to his speciousness, till at length the world
perhaps might have been searched in vain for his competitor.

He had been introduced to Ormond under the most favourable auspices. He
had provided against a danger which he knew to be imminent, by relating
his own story as if it were his brother's. He had, however, made
various additions to it, serving to aggravate the heinousness of his
guilt. This arose partly from policy, and partly from the habit of
lying, which was prompted by a fertile invention, and rendered
inveterate by incessant exercise. He interwove in his tale an intrigue
between Miss Dudley and his brother. The former was seduced, and this
man had employed his skill in chirographical imitation, in composing
letters from Miss Dudley to his brother, which sufficiently attested her
dishonour. He and his brother, he related, to have met in Jamaica, where
the latter died, by which meant his personal property and papers came
into his possession.

Ormond read the letter which his companion presented to him on this
occasion. The papers which Craig had formerly permitted him to inspect
had made him familiar with her handwriting. The penmanship was, indeed,
similar, yet this was written in a spirit not quite congenial with that
which had dictated her letters to her lover. But he reflected that the
emergency was extraordinary, and that the new scenes through which she
had passed, had, perhaps, enabled her to retrieve her virtue and enforce
it. The picture which she drew of her father's distresses affected him
and his companion very differently. He pondered on it for some time in
silence; he then looked up, and with his usual abruptness said, "I
suppose you gave her something?"

"No. I was extremely sorry that it was not in my power. I have nothing
but a little trifling silver about me. I I have no more at home than
will barely suffice to pay my board here, and my expenses to Baltimore.
Till I reach there I cannot expect a supply. I was less uneasy I confess
on this account, because I knew you to be equally willing and much more
able to afford the relief she asks."

This Mr. Ormond had predetermined to do. He paused only to deliberate in
what manner it could, with most propriety, be done. He was always
willing, when he conferred benefits, to conceal the author. He was not
displeased when gratitude was misplaced, and readily allowed his
instruments to act as if they were principals. He questioned not the
veracity of Craig, and was, therefore, desirous to free him from the
molestation that was threatened in the way which had been prescribed. He
put a note of one hundred dollars into his hand, and enjoined him to
send it to the Dudleys that evening, or early the next morning. "I am
pleased," he added, "with the style of this letter: It can be of no
service to you; leave it in my possession."

Craig would much rather have thrown it into the fire; but he knew the
character of his companion, and was afraid to make any objection to his
request. He promised to send, or carry the note the next morning,
before he set out on his intended journey.

This journey was to Baltimore, and was undertaken so soon merely to
oblige his friend, who was desirous of remitting to Baltimore a
considerable sum in English guineas, and who had been for some time in
search of one who might execute this commission with fidelity. The offer
of Craig had been joyfully accepted, and next morning had been the time
fixed for his departure, a period the most opportune for Craig's designs
that could be imagined. To return to Miss Dudley.

The sum that remained to her after the discharge of her debts would
quickly be expended. It was no argument of wisdom to lose sight of the
future in the oblivion of present care. The time would inevitably come
when new resources would be necessary. Every hour brought nearer the
period without facilitating the discovery of new expedients. She related
the recent adventure to her father. He acquiesced in the propriety of
her measures, but the succour that she had thus obtained consoled him
but little. He saw how speedily it would again be required, and was
hopeless of a like fortunate occurrence.

Some days had elapsed, and Constantia had been so fortunate as to
procure some employment. She was thus engaged in the evening when they
were surprised by a visit from their landlord. This was an occurrence
that foreboded them no good. He entered with abruptness, and scarcely
noticed the salutations that he received. His bosom swelled with
discontent, which seemed ready to be poured out upon his two companions.
To the inquiry as to the condition of his health and that of his family,
he surlily answered: "Never mind how I am: none the better for my
tenants I think. Never was a man so much plagued as I have been; what
with one putting me off from time to time; what with another quarrelling
about terms, and denying his agreement, and another running away in my
debt, I expect nothing but to come to poverty--God help me!--at last.
But this was the worst of all. I was never before treated so in all my
life. I don't know what or when I shall get to the end of my troubles.
To be fobbed out of my rent and twenty-five dollars into the bargain! It
is very strange treatment, I assure you, Mr. Dudley."

"What is it you mean?" replied that gentleman. "You have received your
dues, and--"

"Received my dues, indeed! High enough too! I have received none of my
dues. I have been imposed upon. I have been put to very great trouble,
and expect some compensation. There is no knowing the character of one's
tenants. There is nothing but knavery in the world one would think. I'm
sure no man has suffered more by bad tenants than I have. But this is
the strangest treatment I ever met with. Very strange indeed, Dudley,
and I must be paid without delay. To lose my rent and twenty-five
dollars into the bargain, is too hard. I never met with the equal of
it--not I. Besides, I wou'dn't be put to all this trouble for twice the
sum."

"What does all this mean, Mr. M'Crea? You seem inclined to scold; but I
cannot conceive why you came here for that purpose. This behaviour is
improper--"

"No, it is very proper, and I want payment of my money. Fifty dollars
you owe me. Miss comes to pay me my rent as I thought. She brings me a
fifty-dollar note; I changes it for her, for I thought to be sure I was
quite safe: but, behold, when I sends it to the bank to get the money,
they sends me back word that it's forged, and calls on me, before a
magistrate, to tell them where I got it from. I'm sure I never was so
flustered in my life. I would not have such a thing for ten times the
sum."

He proceeded to descant on his loss without any interruption from his
auditors, whom this intelligence had struck dumb. Mr. Dudley instantly
saw the origin and full extent of this misfortune. He was, nevertheless,
calm, and indulged in no invectives against Craig. "It is all of a
piece," said he: "our ruin is inevitable. Well then, let it come."

After M'Crea had railed himself weary, he flung out of the house,
warning them that next morning he should distrain for his rent, and, at
the same time, sue them for the money that Constantia had received in
exchange for her note.

Miss Dudley was unable to pursue her task. She laid down her needle, and
fixed her eyes upon her father. They had been engaged in earnest
discourse when their landlord entered. Now there was a pause of profound
silence, till the affectionate Lucy, who sufficiently comprehended this
scene, gave vent to her affliction in sobs. Her mistress turned to
her:--

"Cheer up, my Lucy. We shall do well enough, my girl. Our state is bad
enough, without doubt, but despair will make it worse."

The anxiety that occupied her mind related less to herself than to her
father. He, indeed in the present instance, was exposed to prosecution.
It was he who was answerable for the debt, and whose person would be
thrown into durance by the suit that was menaced. The horrors of a
prison had not hitherto been experienced or anticipated. The worst evil
that she had imagined was inexpressibly inferior to this. The idea had
in it something of terrific and loathsome. The mere supposition of its
being possible was not to be endured. If all other expedients should
fail, she thought of nothing less than desperate resistance. No. It was
better to die than to go to prison.

For a time she was deserted of her admirable equanimity. This, no doubt,
was the result of surprise. She had not yet obtained the calmness
necessary to deliberation. During this gloomy interval, she would,
perhaps, have adapted any scheme, however dismal and atrocious, which
her father's despair might suggest. She would not refuse to terminate
her own and her father's unfortunate existence by poison or the cord.

This confusion of mind could not exist long; it gradually gave place to
cheerful prospects. The evil perhaps was not without its timely remedy.
The person whom she had set out to visit, when her course was diverted
by Craig, she once more resolved to apply to; to lay before him, without
reserve, her father's situation, to entreat pecuniary succour, and to
offer herself as a servant in his family, or in that of any of his
friends who stood in need of one. This resolution, in a slight degree,
consoled her; but her mind had been too thoroughly disturbed to allow
her any sleep during that night.

She equipped herself betimes, and proceeded with a doubting heart to the
house of Mr. Melbourne. She was informed that he had risen, but was
never to be seen at so early an hour. At nine o'clock he would be
disengaged, and she would be admitted. In the present state of her
affairs this delay was peculiarly unwelcome. At breakfast, her suspense
and anxieties would not allow her to eat a morsel; and when the hour
approached she prepared herself for a new attempt.

As she went out, she met at the door a person whom she recognized, and
whose office she knew to be that of a constable. Constantia had
exercised, in her present narrow sphere, that beneficence which she had
formerly exerted in a larger. There was nothing, consistent with her
slender means, that she did not willingly perform for the service of
others. She had not been sparing of consolation and personal aid in
many cases of personal distress that had occurred in her neighbourhood
Hence, as far as she was known, he was reverenced.

The wife of their present visitant had experienced her succour and
sympathy, on occasion of the death of a favourite child. The man,
notwithstanding his office, was not of a rugged or ungrateful temper.
The task that was now imposed upon him he undertook with extreme
reluctance. He was somewhat reconciled to it by the reflection that
another might not perform it with that gentleness and lenity which he
found in himself a disposition to exercise on all occasions, but
particularly on the present.

She easily guessed at his business, and having greeted him with the
utmost friendliness, returned with him into the house. She endeavoured
to remove the embarrassment that hung about him, but in vain. Having
levied what the law very properly calls a distress, he proceeded, after
much hesitation, to inform Dudley that he was charged with a message
from a magistrate, summoning him to come forthwith, and account for
having a forged banknote in his possession.

M'Crea had given no intimation of this. The painful surprise that it
produced soon yielded to a just view of this affair. Temporary
inconvenience and vexation was all that could be dreaded from it. Mr.
Dudley hated to be seen or known. He usually walked out in the dusk of
evening, but limited his perambulations to a short space. At all other
times he was obstinately recluse. He was easily persuaded by his
daughter to allow her to perform this unwelcome office in his stead. He
had not received, nor even seen the note. He would have willingly spared
her the mortification of a judicial examination, but he knew that this
was unavoidable. Should he comply with this summons himself, his
daughter's presence would be equally necessary.

Influenced by these considerations, he was willing that his daughter
should accompany the messenger, who was content that they should consult
their mutual convenience in this respect. This interview was to her not
without its terrors; but she cherished the hope that it might ultimately
conduce to good. She did not foresee the means by which this would be
effected, but her heart was lightened by a secret and inexplicable faith
in the propitiousness of some event that was yet to occur. This faith
was powerfully enforced when she reached the magistrate's door, and
found that he was no other than Melbourne, whose succour she intended to
solicit. She was speedily ushered, not into his office, but into a
private apartment, where he received her alone.

He had been favourably prepossessed with regard to her character by the
report of the officer who, on being charged with the message, had
accounted for the regret which he manifested, by dwelling on the merits
of Miss Dudley. He behaved with grave civility, requested her to be
seated, and accurately scrutinized her appearance. She found herself not
deceived in her preconceptions of this gentleman's character, and drew a
favourable omen as to the event of this interview by what had already
taken place. He viewed her in silence for some time, and then, in a
conciliating tone, said:--

"It seems to me, madam, as if I had seen you before. Your face, indeed,
is of that kind which, when once seen, is not easily forgotten. I know
it is a long time since, but I cannot tell when or where. If you will
not deem me impertinent, I will venture to ask you to assist my
conjectures. Your name, as I am informed, is Acworth."--(I ought to have
mentioned that Mr. Dudley, on his removal from New York, among other
expedients to obliterate the memory of his former condition, and
conceal his poverty from the World, had made this change in his name.)

"That, indeed," said the lady, "is the name which my father at present
bears. His real name is Dudley. His abode was formerly in Queen Street,
New York. Your conjecture, Sir, is not erroneous. This is not the first
time we have seen each other. I well recollect your having been at my
father's house in the days of his prosperity."

"Is it possible?" exclaimed Mr. Melbourne, starting from his seat in the
first impulse of his astonishment. "Are you the daughter of my friend
Dudley, by whom I have so often been hospitably entertained? I have
heard of his misfortunes, but knew not that he was alive, or in what
part of the world he resided.

"You are summoned on a very disagreeable affair, but I doubt not you
will easily exculpate your father. I am told that he is blind, and that
his situation is by no means as comfortable as might be wished. I am
grieved that he did not confide in the friendship of those that knew
him. What could prompt him to conceal himself?"

"My father has a proud spirit. It is not yet broken by adversity. He
disdains _to beg_, but I must now assume _that office_ for his sake. I
came hither this morning to lay before you his situation, and to entreat
your assistance to save him from a prison. He cannot pay for the poor
tenement he occupies; and our few goods are already under distress. He
has, likewise, contracted a debt. He is, I suppose, already sued on this
account, and must go to gaol, unless saved by the interposition of some
friend."

"It is true," said Melbourne, "I yesterday granted a warrant against him
at the suit of Malcolm M'Crea. Little did I think that the defendant was
Stephen Dudley; but you may dismiss all apprehensions on that score.
That affair shall be settled to your father's satisfaction: meanwhile
we will, if you please, despatch this unpleasant business respecting a
counterfeit note received in payment from you by this M'Crea."

Miss Dudley satisfactorily explained that affair. She stated the
relation in which Craig had formerly stood to her father, and the acts
of which he had been guilty. She slightly touched on the distresses
which the family had undergone during their abode in this city, and the
means by which she had been able to preserve her father from want. She
mentioned the circumstances which compelled her to seek his charity as
the last resource, and the casual encounter with Craig, by which she was
for the present diverted from that design. She laid before him a copy of
the letter she had written, and explained the result in the gift of the
note which now appeared to be a counterfeit. She concluded with stating
her present views, and soliciting him to receive her into his family, in
quality of a servant, or use his interest with some of his friends to
procure a provision of this kind. This tale was calculated deeply to
affect a man of Mr. Melbourne's humanity.

"No," said he, "I cannot listen to such a request. My inclination is
bounded by my means. These will not allow me to place you in an
independent situation; but I will do what I can. With your leave, I will
introduce you to my wife in your true character. Her good sense will
teach her to set a just value on your friendship. There is no disgrace
in earning your subsistence by your own industry. She and her friends
will furnish you with plenty of materials; but if there ever be a
deficiency, look to them for a supply."

Constantia's heart overflowed at this declaration. Her silence was more
eloquent than any words could have been. She declined an immediate
introduction to his wife, and withdrew; but not till her new friend had
forced her to accept some money.

"Place it to account," said he. "It is merely paying you before hand,
and discharging a debt at the time when it happens to be most useful to
the creditor."

To what entire and incredible reverses is the tenor of human life
subject! A short minute shall effect a transition from a state utterly
destitute of hope to a condition where, all is serene and abundant. The
path, which we employ all our exertions to shun, is often found, upon
trial, to be the true road to prosperity.

Constantia retired from this interview with a heart bounding with
exultation. She related to her father all that had happened. He was
pleased on her account, but the detection of his poverty by Melbourne
was the parent of new mortification. His only remaining hope relative to
himself was that he should die in his obscurity, whereas, it was
probable that his old acquaintance would trace him to his covert. This
prognostic filled him with the deepest inquietude, and all the
reasonings of his daughter were insufficient to appease him.

Melbourne made his appearance in the afternoon. He was introduced by
Constantia to her father. Mr. Dudley's figure was emaciated, and his
features corroded by his ceaseless melancholy. His blindness produced in
them a woeful and wildering expression. His dress betokened his penury,
and was in unison with the meanness of his habitation and furniture. The
visitant was struck with the melancholy contrast, which these
appearances exhibited, to the joyousness and splendour that he had
formerly witnessed.

Mr. Dudley received the salutations of his guest with an air of
embarrassment and dejection. He resigned to his daughter the task of
sustaining the conversation, and excused himself from complying with the
urgent invitations of Melbourne, while, at the same time, he studiously
forebore all expressions tending to encourage any kind of intercourse
between them.

The guest came with a message from his wife, who entreated Miss Dudley's
company to tea with her that evening, adding that she should be entirely
alone. It was impossible to refuse compliance with this request. She
cheerfully assented, and in the evening was introduced to Mrs. Melbourne
by her husband.

Constantia found in this lady nothing that called for reverence or
admiration, though she could not deny her some portion of esteem. The
impression which her own appearance and conversation made upon her
entertainer was much more powerful and favourable. A consciousness of
her own worth, and disdain of the malevolence of fortune, perpetually
shone forth in her behaviour. It was modelled by a sort of mean between
presumption on the one hand, and humility on the other. She claimed no
more than what was justly due to her, but she claimed no less. She did
not soothe our vanity nor fascinate our pity by diffident reserves and
fluttering. Neither did she disgust by arrogant negligence, and
uncircumspect loquacity.

At parting she received commissions in the way of her profession, which
supplied her with abundant and profitable employment. She abridged her
visit on her father's account, and parted from her new friend just early
enough to avoid meeting with Ormond, who entered the house a few minutes
after she had left it.

"What pity," said Melbourne to him, "you did not come a little sooner.
You pretend to be a judge of beauty. I should like to have heard your
opinion of a face that has just left us."

"Describe it," said the other.

"That is beyond my capacity. Complexion, and hair, and eyebrows may be
painted, but these are of no great value in the present case. It is in
the putting them together that nature has here shown her skill, and not
in the structure of each of the parts, individually considered. Perhaps
you may at some time meet each other here. If a lofty fellow like you,
now, would mix a little common sense with his science, this girl might
hope for a husband, and her father for a natural protector."

"Are they ill search of one or the other?"

"I cannot say they are. Nay, I imagine they would hear any imputation
with more patience than that, but certain I am, they stand in need of
them. How much would it be to the honour of a man like you rioting in
wealth, to divide it with one, lovely and accomplished as this girl is,
and struggling with indigence!"

Melbourne then related the adventure of the morning. It was easy for
Ormond to perceive that this was the same person of whom he already had
some knowledge; but there were some particulars in the narrative that
excited surprise. A note had been received from Craig, at the first
visit in the evening, and this note was for no more than fifty dollars.
This did not exactly tally with the information received from Craig. But
this note was forged. Might not this girl mix a little imposture with
her truth? Who knows her temptations to hypocrisy? It might have been a
present from another quarter, and accompanied with no very honourable
conditions. Exquisite wretch! Those whom honesty will not let live must
be knaves. Such is the alternative offered by the wisdom of society.

He listened to the tale with apparent indifference. He speedily shifted
the conversation to new topics, and put an end to his visit sooner than
ordinary.




CHAPTER II.


I know no task more arduous than a just delineation of the character of
Ormond. To scrutinize and ascertain our own principles is abundantly
difficult. To exhibit these principles to the world with absolute
sincerity can hardly be expected. We are prompted to conceal and to
feign by a thousand motives; but truly to portray the motives, and
relate the actions of another, appears utterly impossible. The attempt,
however, if made with fidelity and diligence, is not without its use.

To comprehend the whole truth with regard to the character and conduct
of another, may be denied to any human being, but different observers
will have, in their pictures, a greater or less portion of this truth.
No representation will be wholly false, and some, though not perfectly,
may yet be considerably exempt from error.

Ormond was of all mankind the being most difficult and most deserving to
be studied. A fortunate concurrence of incidents has unveiled his
actions to me with more distinctness than to any other. My knowledge is
far from being absolute, but I am conscious of a kind of duty, first to
my friend, and secondly to mankind, to impart the knowledge I possess.

I shall omit to mention the means by which I became acquainted with his
character, nor shall I enter, at this time, into every part of it. His
political projects are likely to possess an extensive influence on the
future condition of this western world. I do not conceive myself
authorized to communicate a knowledge of his schemes, which I gained, in
some sort, surreptitiously, or at least, by means of which he was not
apprised. I shall merely explain the maxims by which he was accustomed
to regulate his private deportment.

No one could entertain loftier conceptions of human capacity than
Ormond, but he carefully distinguished between men in the abstract, and
men as they are. The former were beings to be impelled, by the breath of
accident, in a right or a wrong road, but whatever direction they should
receive, it was the property of their nature to persist in it. Now this
impulse had been given. No single being could rectify the error. It was
the business of the wise man to form a just estimate of things, but not
to attempt, by individual efforts, so chimerical an enterprise as that
of promoting the happiness of mankind. Their condition was out of the
reach of a member of a corrupt society to control. A mortal poison
pervaded the whole system, by means of which every thing received was
converted into bane and purulence. Efforts designed to ameliorate the
condition of an individual were sure of answering a contrary purpose.
The principles of the social machine must be rectified, before men can
be beneficially active. Our motives may be neutral or beneficent, but
our actions tend merely to the production of evil.

The idea of total forbearance was not less delusive. Man could not be
otherwise than a cause of perpetual operation and efficacy. He was part
of a machine, and as such had not power to withhold his agency.
Contiguousness to other parts, that is, to other men, was all that was
necessary to render him a powerful concurrent. What then was the conduct
incumbent on him? Whether he went forward, or stood still, whether his
motives were malignant, or kind, or indifferent, the mass of evil was
equally and necessarily augmented. It did not follow from these
preliminaries that virtue and duty were terms without a meaning, but
they require us to promote our own happiness and not the happiness of
others. Not because the former end is intrinsically preferable, not
because the happiness of others is unworthy of primary consideration,
but because it is not to be attained. Our power in the present state of
things is subjected to certain limits. A man may reasonably hope to
accomplish his end when he proposes nothing but his own good: any other
point is inaccessible.

He must not part with benevolent desire: this is a constituent of
happiness. He sees the value of general and particular felicity; he
sometimes paints it to his fancy, but if this be rarely done, it is in
consequence of virtuous sensibility, which is afflicted on observing
that his pictures are reversed in the real state of mankind. A wise man
will relinquish the pursuit of general benefit, but not the desire of
that benefit, or the perception of that in which this benefit consists,
because these are among the ingredients of virtue and the sources of
his happiness.

Principles, in the looser sense of that term, have little influence on
practice. Ormond was, for the most part, governed, like others, by the
influences of education and present circumstances. It required a
vigilant discernment to distinguish whether the stream of his actions
flowed from one or the other. His income was large, and he managed it
nearly on the same principles as other men. He thought himself entitled
to all the splendour and ease which it would purchase, but his taste was
elaborate and correct. He gratified his love of the beautiful, because
the sensations it afforded were pleasing, but made no sacrifices to the
love of distinction. He gave no expensive entertainments for the sake of
exciting the admiration of stupid gazers, or the flattery or envy of
those who shared them. Pompous equipage and retinue were modes of
appropriating the esteem of mankind which he held in profound contempt.
The garb of his attendants was fashioned after the model suggested by
his imagination, and not in compliance with the dictates of custom.

He treated with systematic negligence the etiquette that regulates the
intercourse of persons of a certain class. He every where acted, in this
respect, as if he were alone, or among familiar associates. The very
appellations of Sir, and Madam, and Mister, were, in his apprehension,
servile and ridiculous, and as custom or law had annexed no penalty to
the neglect of these, he conformed to his own opinions. It was easier
for him to reduce his notions of equality to practice than for most
others. To level himself with others was an act of condescension and not
of arrogance. It was of requisite to descend rather than to risk,--a
task the most easy, if we regard the obstacle flowing from the prejudice
of mankind, but far most difficult if the motive of the agent be
considered.

That in which he chiefly placed his boast, was his sincerity. To this he
refused no sacrifice. In consequence of this, his deportment was
disgusting to weak minds, by a certain air of ferocity and haughty
negligence. He was without the attractions of candour, because he
regarded not the happiness of others, but in subservience to his
sincerity. Hence it was natural to suppose that the character of this
man was easily understood. He affected to conceal nothing. No one
appeared more exempt from the instigations of vanity. He set light by
the good opinions of others, had no compassion for their prejudices and
hazarded assertions in their presence which he knew would be, in the
highest degree, shocking to their previous notions. They might take it,
he would say, as they list. Such were his conceptions, and the last
thing he would give up was the use of his tongue. It was his way to give
utterance to the suggestions of his understanding. If they were
disadvantageous to him, the opinions of others, it was well. He did not
want to be regarded in any light but the true one. He was contented to
be rated by the world at his just value. If they esteemed him for
qualities which he did not possess, was he wrong in rectifying their
mistake: but in reality, if they valued him for that to which he had no
claim, and which he himself considered as contemptible, he must
naturally desire to show them their error, and forfeit that praise
which, in his own opinion, was a badge of infamy.

In listening to his discourse, no one's claim to sincerity appeared less
questionable. A somewhat different conclusion would be suggested by a
survey of his actions. In early youth he discovered in himself a
remarkable facility in imitating the voice and gestures of others. His
memory was eloquently retentive, and these qualities would have rendered
his career, in the theatrical profession, illustrious, had not his
condition raised him above it. His talents were occasionally exerted for
the entertainment of convivial parties and private circles, but he
gradually withdrew from such scenes as he advanced in age, and devoted
his abilities to higher purposes.

His aversion to duplicity had flowed from experience of its evils. He
had frequently been made its victim; inconsequence of this his temper
had become suspicious, and he was apt to impute deceit on occasions when
others, of no inconsiderable sagacity, were abundantly disposed to
confidence. One transaction had occurred in his life, in which the
consequences of being misled by false appearances were of the utmost
moment to his honour and safety. The usual mode of salving his doubt he
deeded insufficient, and the eagerness of his curiosity tempted him,
for, the first time, to employ, for this end, his talent at imitation.
He therefore assumed a borrowed character and guise, and performed his
part with so much skill as fully to accomplish life design. He whose
mask would have secured him from all other attempts, was thus taken
through an avenue which his caution had overlooked, and the hypocrisy of
his pretensions unquestionably ascertained.

Perhaps, in a comprehensive view, the success of this expedient was
unfortunate. It served to recommend this method of encountering deceit,
and informed him of the extent of those powers which are so liable to be
abused. A subtlety much inferior to Ormond would suffice to recommend
this mode of action. It was defensible on no other principle than
necessity. The treachery of mankind compelled him to resort to it. If
they should deal in a manner as upright and explicit as himself, it
would be superfluous. But since they were in the perpetual use of
stratagems and artifices, it was allowable, he thought, to wield the
same arms.

It was easy to perceive, however, that this practice was recommended to
him by other considerations. He was delighted with the power it
conferred. It enabled him to gain access, as if by supernatural means,
to the privacy of others, and baffle their profoundest contrivances to
hide themselves from his view. It flattered him with the possession of
something like omniscience. It was besides an art, in which, as in
others, every accession of skill was a source of new gratification.
Compared with this, the performance of the actor is the sport of
children. This profession he was accustomed to treat with merciless
ridicule, and no doubt some of his contempt arose from a secret
comparison between the theatrical species of imitation and his own. He
blended in his own person the functions of poet and actor, and his
dramas were not fictitious but real. The end that he proposed was not
the amusement of a playhouse mob. His were scenes in which hope and fear
exercised a genuine influence, and in which was maintained that
resemblance to truth so audaciously and grossly violated on the stage.

It is obvious how many singular conjunctures must have grown out of this
propensity. A mind of uncommon energy like Ormond's, which had occupied
a wide sphere of action, and which could not fail of confederating its
efforts with those of minds like itself, must have given birth to
innumerable incidents, not unworthy to be exhibited by the most eloquent
historian. It is not my business to relate any of these. The fate of
Miss Dudley is intimately connected with him. What influence he obtained
over her destiny, in consequence of this dexterity, will appear in the
sequel.

It arose from these circumstances, that no one was more impenetrable
than Ormond, though no one's real character seemed more easily
discerned. The projects that occupied his attention were diffused over
an ample space; and his instruments and coadjutors were culled from a
field, whose bounds were those of the civilized world. To the vulgar
eye, therefore, he appeared a man of speculation and seclusion, and was
equally inscrutable in his real and assumed characters. In his real, his
intents were too lofty and comprehensive, as well as too assiduously
shrouded from profane inspection for them to scan. In the latter,
appearances were merely calculated to mislead and not to enlighten.

In his youth he had been guilty of the usual excesses incident to his
age and character. These had disappeared and yielded place to a more
regular and circumspect system of action. In the choice of his pleasures
he still exposed himself to the censure of the world. Yet there was more
of grossness and licentiousness in the expression of his tenets, than
in the tenets themselves. So far as temporance regards the maintenance
of health, no man adhered to its precepts with more fidelity, but he
esteemed some species of connection with the other sex as venial, which
mankind in general are vehement in condemning.

In his intercourse with women he deemed himself superior to the
allurements of what is called love. His inferences were drawn from a
consideration of the physical propensities of a human being. In his
scale of enjoyments the gratifications which belonged to these were
placed at the bottom. Yet he did not entirely disdain them, and when
they could be purchased without the sacrifice of superior advantages,
they were sufficiently acceptable.

His mistake on this head was the result of his ignorance. He had not
hitherto met with a female worthy of his confidence. Their views were
limited and superficial, or their understandings were betrayed by the
tenderness of their hearts. He found in them no intellectual energy, no
superiority to what he accounted vulgar prejudice, and no affinity with
the sentiments which he cherished with most devotion. Their presence had
been capable of exciting no emotion which he did not quickly discover to
be vague and sensual; and the uniformity of his experience at length
instilled into him a belief, that the intellectual constitution of
females was essentially defective. He denied the reality of that passion
which claimed a similitude or sympathy of minds as one of its
ingredients.




CHAPTER III.


He resided in New York some time before he took up his abode in
Philadelphia. He had some pecuniary concerns with a merchant of that
place. He occasionally frequented his house, finding, in the society
which it afforded him, scope for amusing speculation, and opportunities
of gaining a species of knowledge of which at that time he stood in
need. There was one daughter of the family, who of course constituted a
member of the domestic circle.

Helena Cleves was endowed with every feminine and fascinating quality.
Her features were modified by the most transient sentiments, and were
the seat of a softness at all times blushful and bewitching. All those
graces of symmetry, smoothness, and lustre, which assemble in the
imagination of the painter when he calls from the bosom of her natal
deep the Paphian divinity, blended their perfections in the shape,
complexion, and hair of this lady. Her voice was naturally thrilling and
melodious, and her utterance clear and distinct. A musical education had
added to all these advantages the improvements of art, and no one could
swim in the dance with such airy and transporting elegance.

It is obvious to inquire whether her mental were, in any degree, on a
level with her exterior accomplishments. Should you listen to her talk,
you would be liable to be deceived in this respect. Her utterance was so
just, her phrases so happy, and her language so copious and correct,
that the hearer was apt to be impressed with an ardent veneration of her
abilities, but the truth is, she was calculated to excite emotions more
voluptuous than dignified. Her presence produced a trance of the senses
rather than an illumination of the soul. It was a topic of wonder how
she should have so carefully separated the husk from the kernel, and he
so absolute a mistress of the vehicle of knowledge, with so slender
means of supplying it: yet it is difficult to judge but from comparison.
To say that Helena Cleves was silly or ignorant would be hatefully
unjust. Her understanding bore no disadvantageous comparison with that
of the majority of her sex; but when placed in competition with that of
some eminent females or of Ormond, it was exposed to the risk of
contempt.

This lady and Ormond were exposed to mutual examination. The latter was
not unaffected by the radiance that environed this girl, but her true
character was easily discovered, and he was accustomed to regard her
merely as an object charming to the senses. His attention to her was
dictated by this principle. When she sung or talked, it was not
unworthy of the strongest mind to be captivated with her music and her
elocution: but these were the limits which he set to his gratifications.
That sensations of a different kind never ruffled his tranquillity must
not be supposed, but he too accurately estimated their consequences to
permit himself to indulge them.

Unhappily the lady did not exercise equal fortitude. During a certain
interval Ormond's visits were frequent, and the insensibly contracted
for him somewhat more than reverence. The tenor of his discourse was
little adapted to cherish her hopes. In the declaration of his opinions
he was never withheld by scruples of decorum, or a selfish regard to his
own interest. His matrimonial tenets were harsh and repulsive. A woman
of keener penetration would have predicted from them the disappointment
of her wishes, but Helena's mind was uninured to the discussion of
logical points and the tracing of remote consequences. His presence
inspired feelings which would not permit her to bestow an impartial
attention on his arguments. It is not enough to say that his reasonings
failed to convince her: the combined influence of passion, and an
unenlightened understanding hindered her from fully comprehending them.
All she gathered was a vague conception of something magnificent and
vast in his character.

Helena was destined to experience the vicissitudes of fortune. Her
father died suddenly and left her without provision. She was compelled
to accept the invitations of a kinswoman, and live, in some sort, a life
of dependence. She was not qualified to sustain this reverse of fortune
in a graceful manner. She could not bear the diminution of her customary
indulgences, and to these privations were added the inquietudes of a
passion which now began to look with an aspect of hopelessness.

These events happened in the absence of Ormond. On his return he made
himself acquainted with them. He saw the extent of this misfortune to a
woman of Helena's character, but knew not in what manner it might be
effectually obviated. He esteemed it incumbent on him to pay her a visit
in her new abode. This token at least of respect or remembrance his duty
appeared to prescribe.

This visit was unexpected by the lady. Surprise is the enemy of
concealment. She was oppressed with a sense of her desolate situation.
She was sitting in her own apartment in a museful posture. Her fancy was
occupied with the image of Ormond, and her tears were flowing at the
thought of their eternal separation, when he entered softly and
unperceived by her. A tap upon the shoulder was the first signal of his
presence. So critical an interview could not fail of unveiling the true
state of the lady's heart. Ormond's suspicions were excited, and these
suspicions speedily led to an explanation.

Ormond retired to ruminate on this discovery. I have already mentioned
his sentiments respecting love. His feelings relative to Helena did not
contradict his principles, yet the image which had formerly been
exquisite in loveliness had now suddenly gained unspeakable attractions.
This discovery had set the question in a new light. It was of sufficient
importance to make him deliberate. He reasoned somewhat in the following
manner:--

"Marriage is absurd. This flows from the general and incurable
imperfection of the female character. No woman can possess that worth
which would induce me to enter into this contract, and bind myself,
without power of revoking the decree, to her society. This opinion may
possibly be erroneous, but it is undoubtedly true with respect to
Helena, and the uncertainty of the position in general will increase
the necessity of caution in the present case. That woman may exist whom
I should not fear to espouse. This is not her. Some accident may cause
our meeting. Shall I then disable myself, by an irrevocable obligation,
from profiting by so auspicious an occurrence?"

This girl's society was to be enjoyed in one of two ways. Should he
consult his inclination there was little room for doubt. He had never
met with one more highly qualified for that species of intercourse which
he esteemed rational. No man more abhorred the votaries of
licentiousness. Nothing was more detectable to him than a mercenary
alliance. Personal fidelity and the existence of that passion of which
he had, in the present case, the good fortune to be the object, were
indispensable in his scheme. The union was indebted for its value on the
voluntariness with which it was formed, and the entire acquiescence of
the judgement of both parties in its rectitude. Dissimulation and
artifice were wholly foreign to the success of his project. If the lady
thought proper to assent to his proposal, it was well. She did so
because assent was more eligible than refusal.

She would, no doubt, prefer marriage. She would deem it more conducive
to happiness. This was an error. This was an opinion, his reasons for
which he was at liberty to state to her; at least it was justifiable in
refusing to subject himself to loathsome and impracticable obligations.
Certain inconveniences attended women who set aside, on these occasions,
the sanction of law; but these were imaginary. They owed their force to
the errors of the sufferer. To annihilate them, it was only necessary to
reason justly; but allowing these inconveniences their full weight and
an indestructible existence, it was but a choice of evils. Were they
worse in this lady's apprehension than an eternal and hopeless
separation? Perhaps they were. If so, she would make her election
accordingly. He did nothing but lay the conditions before her. If his
scheme should obtain the concurrence of her unbiased judgement he should
rejoice. If not, her conduct should be influenced by him. Whatever way
she should decide, he would assist her in adhering to her decision, but
would, meanwhile, furnish her with the materials of a right decision.

This determination was singular. Many will regard it as incredible. No
man it will be thought can put this deception on himself, and imagine
that there was genuine beneficence in a scheme like this. Would the lady
more consult her happiness by adopting than by rejecting it? There can
be but one answer. It cannot be supposed that Ormond, in stating this
proposal, acted with all the impartiality that he pretended; that he did
not employ fallacious exaggerations and ambiguous expedients; that he
did not seize every opportunity of triumphing over her weakness, and
building his success rather on the illusions of her heart than the
convictions of her understanding. His conclusions were specious but
delusive, and were not uninfluenced by improper biases; but of this he
himself was scarcely conscious, and it must be at least admitted that he
acted with scrupulous sincerity.

An uncommon degree of skill was required to introduce this topic so as
to avoid the imputation of an insult. This scheme was little in unison
with all her preconceived notions. No doubt the irksomeness of her
present situation, the allurements of luxury and ease which Ormond had
to bestow, and the revival of her ancient independence and security, had
some share in dictating her assent.

Her concurrence was by no means cordial and unhesitating. Remorse and
the sense of dishonour pursued her to her retreat, though chosen with a
view of shunning their intrusions; and it was only when the reasonings
and blandishments of her lover were exhibited, that she was lulled into
temporary tranquillity.

She removed to Philadelphia. Here she enjoyed all the consolations of
opulence. She was mistress of a small but elegant mansion. She possessed
all the means of solitary amusement, and frequently enjoyed the company
of Ormond. These however were insufficient to render her happy. Certain
reflections might, for a time, be repressed as divested of their sting,
but they insinuated themselves at every interval, and imparted to her
mind a hue of rejection from which she could not entirely relieve
herself.

She endeavoured to acquire a relish for the pursuits of literature, by
which her lonely hours might be cheered; but of this, even in the
blithsomeness and serenity of her former days, she was incapable;
--much more so now when she was the prey of perpetual inquietude. Ormond
perceived this change, not without uneasiness. All his efforts to
reconcile her to her present situation were fruitless. They produced a
momentary effect upon her. The softness of her temper and her attachment
to him would, at his bidding, restore her to vivacity and ease, but the
illumination seldom endured longer than his presence and the novelty of
some amusement with which he had furnished her.

At his next visit, perhaps, he would find that a new task awaited him.
She indulged herself in no recriminations or invectives. She could not
complain that her lover had deceived her. She had voluntarily and
deliberately accepted the conditions prescribed. She regarded her own
disposition to repine as a species of injustice. She laid no claim to an
increase of tenderness. She hinted not a wish for a change of situation;
yet she was unhappy. Tears stole into her eyes, and her thoughts
wandered into gloomy reverie, at moments when least aware of their
reproach, and least willing to indulge them.

Was a change to be desired? Yes; provided that change was equally
agreeable to Ormond, and should be seriously proposed by him: of this
she had no hope. As long as his accents rung in her ears, she even
doubted whether it were to be wished. At any rate, it was impossible to
gain his approbation to it. Her destiny was fixed. It was better than
the cessation of all intercourse, yet her heart was a stranger to all
permanent tranquillity.

Her manners were artless and ingenuous. In company with Ormond her heart
was perfectly unveiled. He was her divinity, to whom every sentiment was
visible, and to whom she spontaneously uttered what she thought, because
the employment was pleasing; because he listened with apparent
satisfaction; and because, in fine, it was the same thing to speak and
to think in his presence. There was no inducement to conceal from him
the most evanescent and fugitive ideas.

Ormond was not an inattentive or indifferent spectator of those
appearances. His friend was unhappy. She shrunk aghast from her own
reproaches and the censure of the world. This morbid sensibility he had
endeavoured to cure, but hitherto in vain. What was the amount of her
unhappiness? Her spirits had formerly been gay; but her gaiety was
capable of yielding place to soul-ravishing and solemn tenderness, after
sedateness was, at those times, the offspring not of reflection but of
passion. There still remained much of her former self. He was seldom
permitted to witness more than the traces of sorrow. In answer to his
inquiries, she, for the most part, described sensations that were gone,
and which she flattered herself and him would never return; but this
hope was always doomed to disappointment. Solitude infallibly conjured
up the ghost which had been laid, and it was plain that argument was no
adequate remedy for this disease.

How far would time alleviate its evils? When the novelty of her
condition should disappear, would she not regard it with other eyes? By
being familiar with contempt, it will lose its sting; but is that to be
wished? Must not the character be thoroughly depraved before the scorn
of our neighbours shall become indifferent? Indifference, flowing from a
sense of justice, and a persuasion that our treatment is unmerited, is
characteristic of the noblest minds; but indifference to obloquy,
because we are habituated to it is a token of peculiar baseness. This,
therefore, was a remedy to be ardently deprecated.

He had egregiously overrated the influence of truth and his own
influence. He had hoped that his victory was permanent. In order to the
success of truth, he was apt to imagine that nothing was needful but
opportunities for a complete exhibition of it. They that inquire and
reason with sufficient deliberateness and caution must inevitably
accomplish their end. These maxims were confuted in the present case. He
had formed no advantageous conceptions of Helena's capacity. His
aversion to matrimony arose from those conceptions; but experience had
shown him that his conclusions, unfavourable as they were, had fallen
short of the truth. Convictions, which he had conceived her mind to be
sufficiently strong to receive and retain, were proved to have made no
other than a momentary impression. Hence his objections to ally himself
to a mind inferior to his own were strengthened rather than diminished.
But he could not endure the thought of being instrumental to her
misery.

Marriage was an efficacious remedy, but he could not as yet bring
himself to regard the aptitude of this cure as a subject of doubt. The
idea of separation sometimes occurred to him. He was not unapprehensive
of the influence of time and absence in curing the most vehement
passion, but to this expedient the lady could not be reconciled. He knew
her too well to believe that she would willingly adopt it. But the only
obstacle to this scheme did not flow from the lady's opposition. He
would probably have found upon experiment as strong an aversion to adopt
it in himself as in her.

It was easy to see the motives by which he would be likely to be swayed
into a change of principles. If marriage were the only remedy, the
frequent repetition of this truth must bring him insensibly to doubt the
rectitude of his determinations against it. He deeply reflected on the
consequences which marriage involves. He scrutinised with the utmost
accuracy the character of his friend, and surveyed it in all its parts.
Inclination could not fail of having some influence on his opinions. The
charms of this favourite object tended to impair the clearness of his
view, and extenuate or conceal her defects. He entered on the
enumeration of her errors with reluctance. Her happiness, had it been
wholly disconnected with his own, might have had less weight in the
balance, but now, every time the scales were suspended, this
consideration acquired new weight.

Most men are influenced in the formation of this contract, by regards
purely physical. They are incapable of higher views. They regard with
indifference every tie that binds them to their contemporaries, or to
posterity. Mind has no part in the motives that guide them. They choose
a wife as they choose any household movable, and when the irritation of
the senses has subsided, the attachment that remains is the offspring
of habit.

Such were not Ormond's modes of thinking. His creed was of too
extraordinary a kind not to merit explication. The terms of this
contract were, in his eyes, iniquitous and absurd. He could not think
with patience of a promise which no time could annul, which pretended to
ascertain contingencies and regulate the future. To forego the liberty
of choosing his companion, and bind himself to associate with one whom
he despised; to raise to his own level whom nature had irretrievably
degraded; to avow and persist in his adherence to a falsehood, palpable
and loathsome to his understanding; to affirm that he was blind, when in
full possession of his senses; to shut his eyes and grope in the dark,
and call upon the compassion of mankind on his infirmity, when his
organs were in no degree impaired, and the scene around him was luminous
and beautiful,--was an height of infatuation that he could never
attain. And why should he be thus self-degraded? Why should he take a
laborious circuit to reach a point which, when attained, was trivial,
and to which reason had pointed out a road short and direct?

A wife is generally nothing more than a household superintendent. This
function could not be more wisely vested than it was at present. Every
thing in his domestic system was fashioned on strict and inflexible
principles. He wanted instruments and not partakers of his
authority,--one whose mind was equal and not superior to the cogent
apprehension and punctual performance of his will; one whose character
was squared with mathematical exactness, to his situation. Helena, with
all her faults, did not merit to be regarded in this light. Her
introduction would destroy the harmony of his scheme, and be, with
respect to herself, a genuine debasement. A genuine evil would thus be
substituted for one that was purely imaginary.

Helena's intellectual deficiencies could not be concealed. She was a
proficient in the elements of no science. The doctrine of lines and
surfaces was as disproportionate with her intellects as with those of
the mock-bird. She had not reasoned on the principles of human action,
nor examined the structure of society. She was ignorant of the past or
present condition of mankind. History had not informed her of the one,
nor the narratives of voyagers, nor the deductions of geography of the
other. The heights of eloquence and poetry were shut out from her view.
She could not commune in their native dialect with the sages of Rome and
Athens. To her those perennial fountains of wisdom and refinement were
sealed. The constitution of nature, the attributes of its author, the
arrangement of the parts of the external universe, and the substance,
modes of operation, and ultimate destiny of human intelligence, were
enigmas unsolved and insoluble by her.

But this was not all. The superstructure could for the present be
spared. Nay, it was desirable that the province of rearing it should be
reserved for him. All he wanted was a suitable foundation; but this
Helena did not possess. He had not hitherto been able to create in her
the inclination or the power. She had listened to his precepts with
docility. She had diligently conned the lessons which he had prescribed,
but the impressions were as fleeting as if they had been made on water.
Nature seemed to have set impassable limits to her attainments.

This indeed was an unwelcome belief. He struggled to invalidate it. He
reflected on the immaturity of her age. What but crude and hasty views
was it reasonable to expect at so early a period? If her mind had not
been awakened, it had proceeded, perhaps from the injudiciousness of
his plans, or merely from their not having been persisted in. What was
wanting but the ornaments of mind to render this being all that poets
have feigned of angelic nature? When he indulged himself in imaging the
union of capacious understanding with her personal loveliness, his
conceptions swelled to a pitch of enthusiasm, and it seemed as if no
labour was too great to be employed in the production of such a
creature. And yet, in the midst of his glowings, he would sink into
sudden dejection at the recollection of that which passion had, for a
time, excluded. To make her wise it would be requisite to change her
sex. He had forgotten that his pupil was a female, and her capacity
therefore limited by nature. This mortifying thought was outbalanced by
nature. Her attainments, indeed, were suitable to the imbecility of her
sex; but did she not surpass in those attainments, the ordinary rate of
women? They must not be condemned, because they are outshone by
qualities that are necessarily male births.

Her accomplishments formed a much more attractive theme. He overlooked
no article in the catalogue. He was confounded at one time, and
encouraged at another, on remarking the contradictions that seemed to be
included in her character. It was difficult to conceive the
impossibility of passing that barrier which yet she was able to touch.
She was no poet. She listened to the rehearsal without emotion, or was
moved, not by the substance of the passage, by the dazzling image, or
the magic sympathy, but by something adscititious; yet, usher her upon
the stage, and no poet could wish for a more powerful organ of his
conceptions. In assuming this office, she appeared to have drank in the
very soul of the dramatist. What was wanting in judgement was supplied
by memory, in the tenaciousness of which she has seldom been rivalled.

Her sentiments were trite and undigested, but were decorated with all
the fluences and melodies of elocution. Her musical instructor had been
a Sicilian, who had formed her style after the Italian model. This man
had likewise taught her his own language. He had supplied her chiefly
with Sicilian compositions, both in poetry and melody, and was content
to be unclassical, for the sake of the feminine and voluptuous graces of
his native dialect.

Ormond was an accurate judge of the proficiency of Helena, and of the
felicity with which these accomplishments were suited to her character.
When his pupil personated the victims of anger and grief, and poured
forth the fiery indignation of Calista, or the maternal despair of
Constantia, or the self-contentions of Ipsipile, he could not deny the
homage which her talents might claim.

Her Sicilian tutor had found her no less tractable as a votary of
painting. She needed only the education of Angelica to exercise as
potent and prolific a pencil. This was incompatible with her condition,
which limited her attainments to the element of this art. It was
otherwise with music. Here there was no obstacle to skill, and here the
assiduities of many years in addition to a prompt and ardent genius, set
her beyond the hopes of rivalship.

Ormond had often amused his fancy with calling up images of excellences
in this art. He saw no bounds to the influence of habit, in augmenting
the speed and multiplying the divisions of muscular motion. The fingers,
by their form and size, were qualified to outrun and elude the most
vigilant eye. The sensibility of keys and wires had limits; but these
limits depended on the structure of the instrument, and the perfection
of its structure was proportioned to the skill of the artist. On
well-constructed keys and strings, was it possible to carry diversities
of movement and pressure too far? How far they could be carried was mere
theme of conjecture, until it was his fate to listen to the magical
performances of Helena, whose volant finger seemed to be self-impelled.
Her touches were creative of a thousand forms of _piano_, and of
numberless transitions from grave to quick, perceptible only to ears
like her own.

In the selection and arrangement of notes there are no limits to
luxuriance and celerity. Helena had long relinquished the drudgery of
imitation. She never played but when there were motives to fervour, and
when she was likely to ascend without impediment, and to maintain for a
suitable period her elevation, to the element of new ideas. The lyrics
of Milton and of Metastasio she sung with accompaniments that never
tired, because they were never repeated. Her harp and clavichord
supplied her with endless combinations, and these, in the opinion of
Ormond, were not inferior to the happiest exertions of Handel and Arne.

Chess was his favourite amusement. This was the only game which he
allowed himself to play. He had studied it with so much zeal and
success, that there were few with whom he deigned to contend. He was
prone to consider it as a sort of criterion of human capacity. He who
had acquired skill in this _science_ could not be infirm in mind; and
yet he found in Helena a competitor not unworthy of all his energies.
Many hours were consumed in this employment, and here the lady was
sedate, considerate, extensive in foresight, and fertile in expedients.

Her deportment was graceful, inasmuch as it flowed from a consciousness
of her defects. She was devoid of arrogance and vanity, neither
imagining herself better than she was, and setting light by those
qualifications which she unquestionably possessed. Such was the mixed
character of this woman.

Ormond was occupied with schemes of a rugged and arduous nature. His
intimate associates and the partakers of his confidence were imbued with
the same zeal and ardent in the same pursuits. Helena could lay no claim
to be exalted to this rank. That one destitute of this claim should
enjoy the privileges of his wife was still a supposition truly
monstrous. Yet the image of Helena, fondly loving him, and a model as he
conceived of tenderness and constancy, devoured by secret remorse, and
pursued by the scorn of mankind,--a mark for slander to shoot at, and an
outcast of society,--did not visit his meditations in vain. The rigour
of his principles began now to relent.

He considered that various occupations are incident to every man. He
cannot be invariably employed in the promotion of one purpose. He must
occasionally unbend, if he desires that the springs of his mind should
retain their full vigour. Suppose his life were divided between business
and amusement. This was a necessary distribution, and sufficiently
congenial with his temper. It became him to select with skill his
sources of amusement. It is true that Helena was unable to participate
in his graver occupations: what then? In whom were blended so many
pleasurable attributes? In her were assembled an exquisite and delicious
variety. As it was, he was daily in her company. He should scarcely be
more so if marriage should take place. In that case, no change in their
mode of life would be necessary. There was no need of dwelling under the
same roof. His revenue was equal to the support of many household
establishments. His personal independence would remain equally
inviolable. No time, he thought, would diminish his influence over the
mind of Helena, and it was not to be forgotten that the transition would
to her be happy. It would reinstate her in the esteem of the world, and
dispel those phantoms of remorse and shame by which she was at present
persecuted.

These were plausible considerations. They tended at least to shake his
resolutions. Time would probably have completed the conquest of his
pride, had not a new incident set the question in a new light.




CHAPTER IV.


The narrative of Melbourne made a deeper impression on the mind of his
guest than was at first apparent. This man's conduct was directed by the
present impulse; and, however elaborate his abstract notions, he seldom
stopped to settle the agreement between his principles and actions. The
use of money was a science like every other branch of benevolence, not
reducible to any fixed principles. No man, in the disbursement of money,
could say whether he was conferring a benefit or injury. The visible and
immediate effects might be good, but evil was its ultimate and general
tendency. To be governed by a view to the present rather than the future
was a human infirmity from which he did not pretend to be exempt. This,
though an insufficient apology for the conduct of a rational being, was
suitable to his indolence, and he was content in all cases to employ it.
It was thus that he reconciled himself to beneficent acts, and
humourously held himself up as an object of censure, on occasions when
most entitled to applause.

He easily procured information as to the character and situation of the
Dudleys. Neighbours are always inquisitive, and happily, in this case,
were enabled to make no unfavourable report. He resolved without
hesitation to supply their wants. This he performed in a manner truly
characteristic. There was a method of gaining access to families, and
marking them in their unguarded attitudes, more easy and effectual than
any other: it required least preparation and cost least pains; the
disguise, also, was of the most impenetrable kind. He had served a sort
of occasional apprenticeship to the art, and executed its functions with
perfect ease. It was the most entire and grotesque metamorphosis
imaginable. It was stepping from the highest to the lowest rank in
society, and shifting himself into a form as remote from his own as
those recorded by Ovid. In a word, it was sometimes his practice to
exchange his complexion and habiliments for those of a negro and a
chimney-sweep, and to call at certain doors for employment. This he
generally secured by importunities, and the cheapness of his services.

When the loftiness of his port, and the punctiliousness of his nicety
were considered, we should never have believed--what yet could be truly
asserted--that he had frequently swept his own chimneys, without the
knowledge of his own servants.[1] It was likewise true, though equally
incredible, that he had played at romps with his scullion, and listened
with patience to a thousand slanders on his own character.

[1] Similar exploits are related of Count de la Lippe and
Wortley Montague.

In this disguise he visited the house of Mr. Dudley. It was nine o'clock
in the morning. He remarked with critical eyes, the minutest
circumstance in the appearance and demeanour of his customers, and
glanced curiously at the house and furniture. Every thing was new and
every thing pleased. The walls, though broken into roughness by
carelessness or time, were adorned with glistening white. The floor,
though loose and uneven, and with gaping seams, had received all the
improvements which cloth and brush could give. The pine tables, rush
chairs, and uncurtained bed, had been purchased at half price, at
vendue, and exhibited various tokens of decay; but care and neatness and
order were displayed in their condition and arrangement.

The lower apartment was the eating and sitting room. It was likewise
Mr. Dudley's bed chamber. The upper room was occupied by Constantia and
Lucy. Ormond viewed every thing with the accuracy of an artist, and
carried away with him a catalogue of every thing visible. The faded form
of Mr. Dudley, that still retained its dignity, the sedateness, graceful
condescension, and personal elegance of Constantia, were new to the
apprehension of Ormond. The contrast between the house and its
inhabitants rendered the appearance more striking. When he had finished
his task he retired, but returning in a quarter of an hour, he presented
a letter to the young lady. He behaved as if by no means desirous of
eluding her interrogatories, and, when she desired him to stay, readily
complied. The letter, unsigned, and without superscription, was to this
effect:--

"The writer of this is acquainted with the transaction between Thomas
Craig and Mr. Dudley. The former is debtor to Mr. Dudley in a large
sum. I have undertaken to pay as much of this debt, and at such times,
as suits my convenience. I have had pecuniary engagements with Craig. I
hold myself, in the sum enclosed, discharging so much of his debt. The
future payments are uncertain, but I hope they will contribute to
relieve the necessities of Mr. Dudley."

Ormond had calculated the amount of what would be necessary for the
annual subsistence of this family on the present frugal plan. He had
regulated his disbursements accordingly.

It was natural to feel curiosity as to the writer of this epistle. The
bearer displayed a prompt and talkative disposition. He had a staring
eye and a grin of vivacity forever at command. When questioned by
Constantia, he answered that the gentleman had forbidden him to mention
his name or the place where he lived. Had he ever met with the same
person before? O yes. He had lived with him from a child. His mother
lived with him still, and his brothers. His master had nothing for him
to do at home, so he sent him out sweeping chimneys, taking from him
only half the money that he earned that way. He was a very good master.

"Then the gentleman had been a long time in the city?"

"O yes. All his life he reckoned. Ho used to live in Walnut Street, but
now he's moved down town." Here he checked himself, and added,--"But I
forgets. I must not tell where he livest. He told me I must'nt."

"He has a family and children, I suppose?"

"O yes. Why, don't you know Miss Hetty and Miss Betsy? There again! I
was going to tell the name, that he said I must not tell."

Constantia saw that the secret might be easily discovered, but she
forbore. She disdained to take advantage of this messenger's imagined
simplicity. She dismissed him with some small addition to his demand,
and with a promise always to employ him in this way.

By this mode Ormond had effectually concealed himself. The lady's
conjectures, founded on this delusive information, necessarily wandered
widely from the truth. The observations that he had made during this
visit afforded his mind considerable employment. The manner in which
this lady had sustained so cruel a reverse of fortune, the cheerfulness
with which she appeared to forego all the gratifications of affluence,
the skill with which she selected her path of humble industry, and the
steadiness with which she pursued it, were proofs of a moral
constitution, from which he supposed the female sex to be debarred. The
comparison was obvious between Constantia and Helena, and the result was
by no means advantageous to the latter. Was it possible that such a one
descended to the level of her father's apprentice? That she sacrificed
her honour to a wretch like that? This reflection tended to repress the
inclination he would otherwise have felt for cultivating her society,
but it did not indispose him to benefit her in a certain way.

On his next visit to his "Bella Siciliana," as he called her, he
questioned her as to the need in which she might stand of the services
of a seamstress; and being informed that they were sometimes wanted, he
recommended Miss Acworth to her patronage. He said that he had heard her
spoken of in favourable terms by the gossips at Melbourne's. They
represented her as a good girl, slenderly provided for, and he wished
that Helena would prefer her to all others.

His recommendation was sufficient. The wishes of Ormond, as soon as they
became known, became hers. Her temper made her always diligent in search
of novelty. It was easy to make work for the needle. In short, she
resolved to send for her the next day. The interview accordingly took
place on the ensuing morning, not without mutual surprise, and, on the
part of the fair Sicilian, not without considerable embarrassment.

This circumstance arose from their having changed their respective
names, though from motives of a very different kind. They were not
strangers to each other, though no intimacy had ever subsisted between
them. Each was merely acquainted with the name, person, and general
character of the other. No circumstance in Constantia's situation tended
to embarrass her. Her mind had attained a state of serene composure,
incapable of being ruffled by an incident of this kind. She merely
derived pleasure from the sight of her old acquaintance. The aspect of
things around her was splendid and gay. She seemed the mistress of the
mansion, and her name was changed. Hence it was unavoidable to conclude
that she was married.

Helena was conscious that appearances were calculated to suggest this
conclusion. The idea was a painful one. She sorrowed to think that this
conclusion was fallacious. The consciousness that her true condition was
unknown to her visitant, and the ignominiousness of that truth, gave an
air of constraint to her behaviour, which Constantia ascribed to a
principle of delicacy.

In the midst of reflections relative to herself, she admitted some share
of surprise at the discovery of Constantia in a situation so inferior to
that in which she had formerly known her. She had heard, in general
terms of the misfortunes of Mr Dudley, but was unacquainted with
particulars; but this surprise, and the difficulty of adapting her
behaviour to circumstances, was only in part the source of her
embarrassment, though by her companion it was wholly attributed to this
cause. Constantia thought it her duty to remove it by open and
unaffected manners. She therefore said, in a sedate and cheerful tone,
"You see me, Madam, in a situation somewhat unlike that in which I
formerly was placed. You will probably regard the change as an unhappy
one; but, I assure you, I have found it far less so than I expected. I
am thus reduced not by my own fault. It is this reflection that enables
me to conform to it without a murmur. I shall rejoice to know that Mrs.
Eden is as happy as I am."

Helena was pleased with this address, and returned an answer full of
sweetness. She had not in her compassion for the fallen, a particle of
pride. She thought of nothing but the contrast between the former
situation of her visitant and the present. The fame of her great
qualities had formerly excited veneration, and that reverence was by no
means diminished by a nearer scrutiny. The consciousness of her own
frailty meanwhile diffused over the behaviour of Helena a timidity and
dubiousness uncommonly fascinating. She solicited Constantia's
friendship in a manner that showed she was afraid of nothing but denial.
An assent was eagerly given, and thenceforth a cordial intercourse was
established between them.

The real situation of Helena was easily discovered. The officious person
who communicated this information, at the same time cautioned Constantia
against associating with one of tainted reputation. This information
threw some light upon appearances. It accounted for that melancholy
which Helena was unable to conceal. It explained that solitude in which
she lived, and which Constantia had ascribed to the death or absence of
her husband. It justified the solicitous silence she had hitherto
maintained respecting her own affairs, and which her friend's good sense
forbade her to employ any sinister means of eluding.

No long time was necessary to make her mistress of Helena's character.
She loved her with uncommon warmth, though by no means blind to her
defects. She formed no expectations from the knowledge of her character,
to which this intelligence operated as a disappointment. It merely
excited her pity, and made her thoughtful how she might assist her in
repairing this deplorable error.

This design was of no ordinary magnitude. She saw that it was previously
necessary to obtain the confidence of Helena. This was a task of easy
performance. She knew the purity of her own motives and the extent of
her powers, and embarked in this undertaking with full confidence of
success. She had only to profit by a private interview, to acquaint her
friend with what she knew, to solicit a complete and satisfactory
disclosure, to explain the impressions which her intelligence produced,
and to offer her disinterested advice. No one knew better how to couch
her ideas in words suitable to the end proposed by her in imparting
them.

Helena was at first terrified, but the benevolence of her friend quickly
entitled her to confidence and gratitude that knew no limits. She had
been deterred from unveiling her heart by the fear of exciting contempt
or abhorrence; but when she found that all due allowances were
made,--that her conduct was treated as erroneous in no atrocious or
inexpiable degree, and as far front being insusceptible of remedy,--that
the obloquy with which she had been treated found no vindicator or
participator in her friend, her heart was considerably relieved. She had
been long a stranger to the sympathy and intercourse of her own sex. Now
this good, in its most precious form, was conferred upon her, and she
experienced an increase rather than diminution of tenderness, in
consequence of her true situation being known.

She made no secret of any part of her history. She did full justice to
the integrity of her lover, and explained the unforced conditions on
which she had consented to live with him. This relation exhibited the
character of Ormond in a very uncommon light. His asperities wounded,
and his sternness chilled. What unauthorised conceptions of matrimonial
and political equality did he entertain! He had fashioned his treatment
of Helena on sullen and ferocious principles. Yet he was able, it
seemed, to mould her, by means of them, nearly into the creature that he
wished. She knew too little of the man justly to estimate his character.
It remained to be ascertained whether his purposes were consistent and
upright, or were those of a villain and betrayer.

Meanwhile what was to be done by Helena? Marriage had been refused op
plausible pretences. Her unenlightened understanding made her no match
for her lover. She would never maintain her claim to nuptial privileges
in his presence, or, if she did, she would never convince him of their
validity.

Were they indeed valid? Was not the disparity between them incurable? A
marriage of minds so dissimilar could only be productive of misery
immediately to him, and, by a reflex operation, to herself. She could
not be happy in a union that was the source of regret to her husband.
Marriage, therefore, was not possible, or if possible, was not, perhaps,
to be wished. But what was the choice that remained?

To continue in her present situation was not to be endured. Disgrace was
a dæmon that would blast every hope of happiness. She was excluded from
all society but that of the depraved. Her situation was eminently
critical. It depended, perhaps, on the resolution she should now form
whether she would be enrolled among the worst of mankind. Infamy is the
worst of evils. It creates innumerable obstructions in the paths of
virtue. It manacles the hand, and entangles the feet that are active
only to good. To the weak it is an evil of much greater magnitude. It
determines their destiny; and they hasten to merit that reproach, which,
at first it may be, they did not deserve.

This connection is intrinsically flagitious. Helena is subjected by it
to the worst ills that are incident to humanity, the general contempt of
mankind, and the reproaches of her own conscience. From these there is
but one method from which she can hope to be relieved. The intercourse
must cease.

It wad easier to see the propriety of separation, than to project means
for accomplishing it. It was true that Helena loved; but what quarter
was due to this passion when divorced from integrity? Is it not in every
bosom a perishable sentiment? Whatever be her warmth, absence will
congeal it. Place her in new scenes, and supply her with new associates.
Her accomplishments will not fail to attract votaries. From these she
may select a conjugal companion suitable to her mediocrity of talents.

But alas! what power on earth can prevail on her to renounce Ormond?
Others may justly entertain this prospect, but it must be invisible to
her. Besides, is it absolutely certain that either her peace of mind or
her reputation will be restored by this means? In the opinion of the
world her offences cannot, by any perseverance in penitence, be
expiated. She will never believe that separation will exterminate
her passion. Certain it is that it will avail nothing to the
re-establishment of her fame. But if it were conducive to these ends,
how chimerical to suppose that she will ever voluntarily adopt it! If
Ormond refuse his concurrence, there is absolutely an end to hope. And
what power on earth is able to sway his determinations? At least, what
influence was it possible for her to obtain over them?

Should they separate, whither should she retire? What mode of
subsistence should she adopt? She has never been accustomed to think
beyond the day. She has eaten and drank, but another has provided the
means. She scarcely comprehends the principle that governs the world,
and in consequence of which nothing can be gained but by giving
something in exchange for it. She is ignorant and helpless as a child,
on every topic that relates to the procuring of subsistence. Her
education has disabled her from standing alone.

But this was not all. She must not only be supplied by others, but
sustained in the enjoyment of a luxurious existence. Would you bereave
her of the gratifications of opulence? You had better take away her
life. Nay, it would ultimately amount to this. She can live but in one
way.

At present she is lovely, and, to a certain degree, innocent; but expose
her to the urgencies and temptations of want, let personal pollution be
the price set upon the voluptuous affluences of her present condition,
and it is to be feared there is nothing in the contexture of her mind to
hinder her from making the purchase. In every respect therefore the
prospect was an hopeless one,--so hopeless, that her mind insensibly
returned to the question which she had at first dismissed with very
slight examination,--the question relative to the advantages and
probabilities of marriage. A more accurate review convinced her that
this was the most eligible alternative. It was, likewise, most easily
effected. The lady, of course, would be its fervent advocate. There did
not want reasons why Ormond should finally embrace it. In what manner
appeals to his reason of his passion might most effectually be made she
knew not.

Helena was not qualified to be her own advocate. Her unhappiness could
not but be visible to Ormond. He had shown himself attentive and
affectionate. Was it impossible that, in time, he should reason himself
into a spontaneous adoption of this scheme? This, indeed, was a slender
foundation for hope, but there was no other on which she could build.

Such were the meditations of Constantia on this topic. She was deeply
solicitous for the happiness of her friend. They spent much of their
time together. The consolations of her society were earnestly sought by
Helena; but to enjoy them, she was for the most part obliged to visit
the former at her own dwelling. For this arrangement, Constantia
apologized by saying, "You will pardon my requesting you to favour me
with your visits, rather than allowing you mine. Every thing is airy
and brilliant within these walls. There is, besides, an air of seclusion
and security about you that is delightful. In comparison, my dwelling is
bleak, comfortless, and unretired, but my father is entitled to all my
care. His infirmity prevents him from amusing himself, and his heart is
cheered by the mere sound of my voice, though not addressed to him. The
mere belief of my presence seems to operate as an antidote to the
dreariness of solitude; and, now you know my motives, I am sure you will
not only forgive but approve of my request."




CHAPTER V.


When once the subject had been introduced, Helena was prone to descant
upon her own situation, and listened with deference to the remarks and
admonitions of her companion. Constantia did not conceal from her any of
her sentiments. She enabled her to view her own condition in its true
light, and set before her the indispensable advantages of marriage,
while she, at the same time, afforded her the best directions as to the
conduct she ought to pursue in order to effect her purpose.

The mind of Helena was thus kept in a state of perpetual and uneasy
fluctuation. While absent from Ormond, or listening to her friend's
remonstrances, the deplorableness of her condition arose in its most
disastrous hues before her imagination. But the spectre seldom failed
to vanish at the approach of Ormond. His voice dissipated every
inquietude.

She was not insensible of this inconstancy. She perceived and lamented
her own weakness. She was destitute of all confidence in her own
exertions. She could not be in the perpetual enjoyment of his company.
Her intervals of tranquillity, therefore, were short, while those of
anxiety and dejection were insupportably tedious. She revered, but
believed herself incapable to emulate the magnanimity of her monitor.
The consciousness of inferiority, especially in a case like this, in
which her happiness so much depended on her own exertions, excited in
her the most humiliating sensations.

While indulging in fruitless melancholy, the thought one day occurred to
her, why may not Constantia be prevailed upon to plead my cause? Her
capacity and courage are equal to any undertaking. The reasonings that
are so powerful in my eyes, would they he trivial and futile in those of
Ormond? I cannot have a more pathetic and disinterested advocate.

This idea was cherished with uncommon ardour. She seized the first
opportunity that offered itself to impart it to her friend. It was a
wild and singular proposal, and was rejected at the first glance. This
scheme, so romantic and impracticable as it at first seemed, appeared to
Helena in the most plausible colours. She could not bear to relinquish
her new-born hopes. She saw no valid objection to it. Every thing was
easy to her friend, provided her sense of duty and her zeal could be
awakened. The subject was frequently suggested to Constantia's
reflections. Perceiving the sanguineness of her friend's confidence, and
fully impressed with the value of the end to be accomplished, she
insensibly veered to the same opinion. At least the scheme was worthy
of a candid discussion before it was rejected.

Ormond was a stranger to her. His manners were repulsive and austere.
She was a mere girl. Her personal attachment to Helena was all that she
could plead in excuse for taking part in her concerns. The subject was
delicate. A blunt and irregular character like Ormond might throw an air
of ridicule over the scene. She shrunk from the encounter of a
boisterous and manlike spirit.

But were not these scruples effeminate and puerile? Had she studied so
long in the school of adversity, without conviction of the duty of a
virtuous independence? Was she not a rational being, fully imbued with
the justice of her cause? Was it not ignoble to refuse the province of a
vindicator of the injured, before any tribunal, however tremendous or
unjust? And who was Ormond, that his eye should inspire terror?

The father or brother of Helena might assume the office without
indecorum. Nay, a mother or sister might not be debarred from it. Why
then should she, who was actuated by equal zeal, and was engaged, by
ties stronger than consanguinity, in the promotion of her friend's
happiness. It is true she did not view the subject in the light in which
it was commonly viewed by brothers and parents. It was not a gust of
rage that should transport her into his presence. She did not go to
awaken his slumbering conscience, and to abash him in the pride of
guilty triumph, but to rectify deliberate errors, and to change his
course by the change of his principles. It was her business to point out
to him the road of duty and happiness, from which he had strayed with no
sinister intentions. This was to be done without raving and fury; but
with amicable soberness, and in the way of calm and rational
remonstrance. Yet, there were scruples that would not be shut out, and
continually whispered to her, "What an office is this for a girl and a
stranger to assume!"

In what manner should it be performed? Should an interview be sought,
and her ideas be explained without confusion or faltering, undismayed by
ludicrous airs or insolent frowns. But this was a point to be examined.
Was Ormond capable of such behaviour? If he were, it would be useless to
attempt the reformation of his errors. Such a man is incurable and
obdurate. Such a man is not to be sought as the husband of Helena; but
this, surely, is a different being.

The medium through which she had viewed his character was an ample one,
but might not be very accurate. The treatment which Helena had received
from him, exclusive of his fundamental error, betokened a mind to which
she did not disdain to be allied. In spite of his defects, she saw that
their elements were more congenial, and the points of contact between
this person and herself more numerous than between her and Helena, whose
voluptuous sweetness of temper, and mediocrity of understanding excited
in her bosom no genuine sympathy.

Every thing is progressive in the human mind. When there is leisure to
reflect, ideas will succeed each other in a long train, before the
ultimate point be gained. The attention must shift from one side to the
other of a given question many times before it settles. Constantia did
not form her resolutions in haste; but when once formed, they were
exempt from fluctuation. She reflected before she acted, and therefore
acted with consistency and vigour. She did not apprize her friend of her
intention. She was willing that she should benefit by her interposition,
before she knew it was employed.

She sent her Lucy with a note to Ormond's house. It was couched in these
terms:--

   "Constantia Dudley requests an interview with Mr. Ormond. Her
   business being of some moment, she wishes him to name an hour when
   most disengaged."

An answer was immediately returned that at three o'clock, in the
afternoon, he should be glad to see her.

This message produced no small surprise in Ormond. He had not withdrawn
his notice from Constantia, and had marked, with curiosity and
approbation, the progress of the connexion between the two women. The
impressions which he had received from the report of Helena were not
dissimilar to those which Constantia had imbibed, from the same quarter,
respecting himself; but he gathered from them no suspicion of the
purpose of a visit. He recollected his connection with Craig. This lady
had had an opportunity of knowing that some connection subsisted between
them. He concluded that some information or inquiry respecting Craig
might occasion this event. As it was, it gave him considerable
satisfaction. It would enable him more closely to examine one, with
respect to whom he entertained great curiosity.

Ormond's conjecture was partly right. Constantia did not forget her
having traced Craig to this habitation. She designed to profit by the
occasion which this circumstance afforded her, of making some inquiry
respecting Craig, in order to introduce, by suitable degrees, a more
important subject.

The appointed hour having arrived, he received her in his drawing-room.
He knew what was due to his guest. He loved to mortify, by his
negligence, the pride of his equals and superiors, but a lower class had
nothing to fear from his insolence. Constantia took the seat that was
offered to her, without speaking. She had made suitable preparations for
this interview, and her composure was invincible. The manners of her
host were by no means calculated to disconcert her. His air was
conciliating and attentive.

She began with naming Craig, as one known to Ormond, and desired to be
informed of his place of abode. She was proceeding to apologise for this
request, by explaining, in general terms, that her father's infirmities
prevented him from acting for himself, that Craig was his debtor to a
large amount, that he stood in need of all that justly belonged to him,
and was in pursuit of some means of tracing Craig to his retreat. Ormond
interrupted her, examining, at the same time, with a vigilance somewhat
too unsparing, the effects which his words should produce upon her:--

"You may spare yourself the trouble of explaining. I am acquainted with
the whole affair between Craig and your family. He has concealed from me
nothing. I know _all_ that has passed between you."

In saying this, Ormond intended that his looks and emphasis should
convey his full meaning. In the style of her comments he saw none of
those corroborating symptoms that he expected:--

"Indeed! He has been very liberal of his confidence. Confession is a
token of penitence; but, alas! I fear he has deceived you. To be sincere
was doubtless his true interest, but he is too much in the habit of
judging superficially. If he has told you all, there is, indeed, no need
of explanation. This visit is, in that case, sufficiently accounted for.
Is it in your power, Sir, to inform us whither he has gone?"

"For what end should I tell you? I promise you you will not follow him.
Take my word for it, he is totally unworthy of you. Let the past be no
precedent for the future. If you have not made that discovery yourself,
I have made it for you. I expect at least to be thanked for my trouble."

This speech was unintelligible to Constantia. Her looks betokened a
perplexity unmingled with fear or shame.

"It is my way," continued he, "to say what I think. I care little for
consequences. I have said that I know _all_. This will excuse me for
being perfectly explicit. That I am mistaken is very possible; but I am
inclined to place that matter beyond the reach of a doubt. Listen to me,
and confirm me in the opinion I have already formed of your good sense,
by viewing, in a just light, the unreservedness with which you are
treated. I have something to tell, which, if you are wise, you will not
be offended at my telling so roundly. On the contrary you will thank me,
and perceive that my conduct is a proof of my respect for you. The
person whom you met here is named Craig, but, as he tells me, is not the
man you look for. This man's brother--the partner, of your father, and,
as he assured me, your own accepted and illicitly-gratified lover--is
dead."

These words were uttered without any extenuating hesitation or
depression of tone. On the contrary, the most offensive terms were drawn
out in the most deliberate and emphatic manner. Constantia's cheeks
glowed, and her eyes sparkled with indignation, but she forbore to
interrupt. The looks with which she listened to the remainder of the
speech showed that she fully comprehended the scene, and enabled him to
comprehend it. He proceeded:--

"This man is a brother of that. Their resemblance in figure occasioned
your mistake. Your father's debtor died, it seems, on his arrival at
Jamaica. There he met with this brother, and bequeathed to him his
property and papers. Some of these papers are in my possession. They are
letters from Constantia Dudley, and are parts of an intrigue, which,
considering the character of the man, was not much to her honour. Such
was this man's narrative told to me some time before your meeting with
him at his house. I have right to judge in this affair; that is, I have
a right to my opinion. If I mistake, (and I half suspect myself,) you
are able, perhaps, to rectify my error; and in a case like this
doubtless you will not want the inclination."

Perhaps if the countenance of this man had not been characterized by the
keenest intelligence, and a sort of careless and overflowing good-will,
this speech might have produced different effects. She was prepared,
though imperfectly, for entering into his character. He waited for an
answer, which she gave without emotion:--

"You were deceived. I am sorry for your own sake that you are. He must
have had some end in view, in imposing these falsehoods upon you, which
perhaps they have enabled him to accomplish. As to myself, this man can
do me no injury. I willingly make you my judge. The letters you speak of
will alone suffice to my vindication. They never were received from me,
and are forgeries. That man always persisted till he made himself the
dupe of his own artifices. That incident in his plot, on the
introduction of which he probably the most applauded himself, will most
powerfully operate to defeat it.

"Those letters never were received from me, and are forgeries. His skill
in imitation extended no farther in the present case than my
handwriting. My model of thinking and expression were beyond the reach
of his mimicry."

When she had finished, Osmond spent a moment in ruminating. "I perceive
you are right," said he. "I suppose he has purloined from me two hundred
guineas, which I entrusted to his fidelity. And yet I received a letter;
but that may likewise be a forgery. By my soul," continued he, in a tone
that had more of satisfaction than disappointment in it, "this fellow
was an adept at his trade. I do not repine. I have bought the
exhibition at a cheap rate. The pains that he took did not merit a less
recompense. I am glad that he was contented with so little. Had he
persisted he might have raised the price far above its value. 'Twill be
lamentable if he receive more than he stipulated for,--if, in his last
purchase, the gallows should be thrown into the bargain. May he have the
wisdom to see that a halter, though not included in his terms, is only a
new instance of his good fortune! But his cunning will hardly carry him
thus far. His stupidity will, no doubt, prefer a lingering to a sudden
exit.

"But this man and his destiny are trifles. Let us leave them to
themselves. Your name is Constantia. 'Twas given you, I suppose, that
you might be known by it. Pr'ythee, Constantia was this the only purpose
that brought you hither? If it were, it has received as ample a
discussion as it merits. You _came_ for this end, but will remain, I
hope, for a better one. Haying dismissed Craig and his plots, let us now
talk of each other."

"I confess," said the lady, with an hesitation she could not subdue,
"this was not my only purpose. One much more important has produced this
visit."

"Indeed! pray let me know it. I am glad that so trivial an object as
Craig did not occupy the first place in your thoughts. Proceed, I
beseech you."

"It is a subject on which I cannot enter without hesitation,--a
hesitation unworthy of me."

"Stop," cried Ormond, rising and touching the bell; "nothing like time
to make a conquest of embarrassment. We will defer this conference six
minutes, just while we eat our dinner."

At the same moment a servant entered, with two plates and the usual
apparatus for dinner. On seeing this she rose, in some hurry, to
depart:--"I thought, sir, you were disengaged? I call at some other
hour."

He seized her hand, and held her from going, but with an air by no means
disrespectful. "Nay," said he, "what is it that scares you away? Are you
terrified at the mention of victuals? You must have fasted long when it
comes to that. I told you true. I am disengaged, but not from the
obligation of eating and drinking. No doubt _you_ have dined. No reason
why _I_ should go without my dinner. If you do not choose to partake
with me, so much the better. Your temperance ought to dispense with two
meals in an hour. Be a looker-on; or, if that will not do, retire into
my library, where in six minutes, I will be with you, and lend you my
aid in the arduous task of telling me what you came with an intention of
telling."

This singular address disconcerted and abashed her. She was contented to
follow the servant silently into an adjoining apartment. Here she
reflected with no small surprise on the behaviour of this man. Though
ruffled, she was not heartily displeased with it. She had scarcely time
to collect herself, when he entered. He immediately seated her, and
himself opposite to her. He fixed his eyes without scruple on her face.
His gaze was steadfast, but not insolent or oppressive. He surveyed her
with the looks with which he would have eyed a charming portrait. His
attention was occupied with what he saw, as that of an artist is
occupied when viewing a madonna of Rafaello. At length he broke
silence:--

"At dinner I was busy in thinking what it was you had to disclose. I
will not fatigue you with my guesses. They would he impertinent, as long
as the truth is going to be disclosed." He paused, and then
continued:--"But I see you cannot dispense with my aid. Perhaps your
business relates to Helena. She has done wrong, and you wish me to
rebuke the girl."

Constantia profited by this opening, and said, "Yes, she has done wrong.
It is true my business relates to her. I came hither as a suppliant in
her behalf. Will you not assist her in recovering the path from which
she has deviated? She left it from confiding more in the judgement of
her guide than her own. There is one method of repairing the evil. It
lies with you to repair that evil."

During this address the gaiety of Ormond disappeared. He fixed his eyes
on Constantia with new and even pathetic earnestness. "I guessed as
much," said he. I have often been deceived in my judgement of
characters. Perhaps I do not comprehend yours. Yet it is not little that
I have heard respecting you. Something I have seen. I begin to suspect a
material error in my theory of human nature. Happy will it be for Helena
if my suspicions be groundless.

"You are Helena's friend. Be mine also, and advise me. Shall I marry
this girl or not? You know on what terms we live. Are they suitable to
our respective characters? Shall I wed this girl, or shall things remain
as they are?

"I have an irreconcilable aversion to a sad brow and a sick bed. Helena
is grieved, because her neighbours sneer and point at her. So far she is
a fool; but that is a folly of which she never will be cured. Marriage,
it seems, will set all right. Answer me, Constantia, shall I marry?"

There was something in the tone, but more in the tenor of this address
that startled her. There was nothing in this man but what came upon her
unaware. This sudden effusion of confidence was particularly unexpected
and embarrassing. She scarcely knew whether to regard it as serious or a
jest. On observing her indisposed to speak, he continued:--

"Away with these impertinent circuities and scruples. I know your
meaning. Why should I pretend ignorance, and put you to the trouble of
explanation? You came hither with no other view than to exact this
question, and furnish an answer. Why should not we come at once to the
point? I have for some time been dubious on this head. There is
something wanting to determine the balance. If you have that something,
throw it into the proper scale.

"You err if you think this manner of addressing you is wild or improper.
This girl is the subject of discourse. If she was not to be so, why did
you favour me with this visit? You have sought me, and introduced
yourself. I have, in like manner, overlooked ordinary forms,--a
negligence that has been systematic with me, but, in the present case,
particularly justifiable by your example. Shame upon you, presumptuous
girl, to suppose yourself the only rational being among mankind. And
yet, if you thought so, why did you thus unceremoniously intrude upon my
retirements? This act is of a piece with the rest. It shows you to be
one whose existence I did not believe possible.

"Take care. You know not what you have done. You came hither as Helena's
friend. Perhaps time may show that in this visit you have performed the
behest of her bitterest enemy. But that is out of season. This girl is
our mutual property. You are her friend; I am her lover. Her happiness
is precious in my eyes and in yours. To the rest of mankind she is a
noisome weed that cannot be shunned too cautiously, nor trampled on too
much. If we forsake her, infamy, that is now kept at bay, will seize
upon her, and, while it mangles her form, will tear from her her
innocence. She has no arms with which to contend against that foe.
Marriage will place her at once in security. Shall it be? You have an
exact knowledge of her strength and her weakness. Of me you know little.
Perhaps, before that question can be satisfactorily answered, it is
requisite to know the qualities of her husband. Be my character
henceforth the subject of your study. I will furnish you with all the
light in my power. Be not hasty in deciding; but, when your decision is
formed, let me know it." He waited for an answer, which she, at length,
summoned resolution enough to give:--

"You have come to the chief point which I had in view in making this
visit. To say truth, I came hither to remonstrate with you on
withholding that which Helena may justly claim from you. Her happiness
will be unquestionably restored, and increased by it. Yours will not be
impaired. Matrimony will not produce any essential change in your
situation. It will produce no greater or different intercourse than now
exists. Helena is on the brink of a gulf which I shudder to look upon.
I believe that you will not injure yourself by snatching her from it. I
am sure that you will confer an inexpressible benefit upon her. Let me
then persuade you to do her and yourself justice."

"No persuasion," said Ormond, after recovering from a fit of
thoughtfulness, "is needful for this end: I only want to be convinced.
You have decided, but, I fear hastily. By what inscrutable influences
are our steps guided! Come, proceed in your exhortations. Argue with the
utmost clearness and cogency. Arm yourself with all the irresistibles of
eloquence. Yet you are building nothing. You are only demolishing. Your
argument is one thing. Its tendency is another; and is the reverse of
all you expect and desire. My assent will be refused with an obstinacy
proportioned to the force that you exert to obtain it, and to the just
application of that force."

"I see," replied the lady, smiling and leaving her seat, "you can talk
in riddles, as well as other people. This visit has been too long. I
shall, indeed, be sorry, if my interference, instead of serving my
friend, has injured her. I have acted an uncommon, and, as it may seem,
an ambiguous part. I shall be contented with construing my motives in my
own way. I wish you a good evening."

"'Tis false," cried he, sternly, "you do not wish it!"

"How?" exclaimed the astonished Constantia.

"I will put your sincerity to the test. Allow me to spend this evening
in your company; then it will be well spent, and I shall believe your
wishes sincere. Else," continued he, changing his affected austerity
into a smile, "Constantia is a liar."

"You are a singular man. I hardly know how to understand you."

"Well. Words are made to carry meanings. You shall have them in
abundance. Your house is your citadel. I will not enter it without
leave. Permit me to visit it when I please. But that is too much. It is
more than I would allow you. When will you permit me to visit you?"

"I cannot answer when I do not understand. You clothe your thoughts in a
garb so uncouth, that I know not in what light they are to be viewed."

"Well, now, I thought you understood my language, and were an
Englishwoman, but I will use another. Shall I have the honour" (bowing
with a courtly air of supplication) "of occasionally paying my respects
to you at your own dwelling? It would be cruel to condemn those who have
the happiness of knowing Miss Dudley, to fashionable restraints. At what
hour will she be least incommoded by a visitant?"

"I am as little pleased with formalities," replied the lady, "as you
are. My friends I cannot see too often. They need to consult merely
their own convenience. Those who are not my friends I cannot see too
seldom. You have only to establish your title to that name, and your
welcome at all times is sure. Till then you must not look for it."




CHAPTER VI.


Here ended this conference. She had by no means suspected the manner in
which it would be conducted. All punctilios were trampled under foot by
the impetuosity of Ormond. Things were, at once, and without delay,
placed upon a certain footing. The point, which ordinary persons would
have employed months in attaining, was reached in a moment. While these
incidents were fresh in her memory, they were accompanied with a sort of
trepidation, the offspring at once of pleasure and surprise.

Ormond had not deceived her expectations; but hearsay and personal
examination, however uniform their testimony may be, produce a very
different impression. In her present reflections, Helena and her lover
approached to the front of the stage, and were viewed with equal
perspicuity. One consequence of this was, that their characters were
more powerfully contrasted with each other, and the eligibility of
marriage appeared not quite so incontestable as before.

Was not equality implied in this compact? Marriage is an instrument of
pleasure or pain in proportion as this equality is more or less. What
but the fascination of his senses is it that ties Ormond to Helena. Is
this a basis en which marriage may properly be built?

If things had not gone thus far, the impropriety of marriage could not
be doubted; but, at present, there is a choice of evils, and that may
now be desirable which at a former period, and in different
circumstances, would have been clearly otherwise.

The evils of the present connection are known; those of marriage are
future and contingent. Helena cannot be the object of a genuine and
lasting passion; another may; this is not merely possible; nothing is
more likely to happen. This event, therefore, ought to be included in
our calculation. There would be a material deficiency without it. What
was the amount of the misery that would in this case ensue?

Constantia was qualified, beyond most others, to form an adequate
conception of this misery. One of the ingredients in her character was a
mild and steadfast enthusiasm. Her sensibilities to social pleasure, and
her conceptions of the benefits to flow from the conformity and
concurrence of intentions and wishes, heightening and refining the
sensual passion, were exquisite.

There, indeed, were evils, the foresight of which tended to prevent
them; but was there wisdom in creating obstacles in the way of a
suitable alliance. Before we act, we must consider not only the misery
produced, but the happiness precluded by our measures.

In no case, perhaps, is the decision of a human being impartial, or
totally uninfluenced by sinister and selfish motives. If Constantia
surpassed others, it was not because her motives were pure, but because
they possessed more of purity than those of others. Sinister
considerations flow in upon us through imperceptible channels, and
modify our thoughts in numberless ways, without our being truly
conscious of their presence. Constantia was young, and her heart was
open at a thousand pores, to the love of excellence. The image of Ormond
occupied the chief place in her fancy, and was endowed with attractive
and venerable qualities. A bias was hence created that swayed her
thoughts, though she knew not that they were swayed. To this might
justly be imputed some part of that reluctance which she now felt to
give Ormond to Helena. But this was not sufficient to turn the scale.
That which had previously mounted was indeed heavier than before; but
this addition did not enable it to outweigh its opposite. Marriage was
still the best upon the whole; but her heart was tortured to think that,
best as it was, it abounded with so many evils.

On the evening of the next day, Ormond entered, with careless
abruptness, Constantia's sitting-apartment. He was introduced to her
father. A general and unrestrained conversation immediately took place.
Ormond addressed Mr. Dudley with the familiarity of an old acquaintance.
In three minutes, all embarrassment was discarded. The lady and her
visitant were accurate observers of each other. In the remarks of the
latter, (and his vein was an abundant one) there was a freedom and
originality altogether new to his hearers. In his easiest and
sprightliest sallies were tokens of a mind habituated to profound and
extensive views. His associations were forced on a comprehensive scale.

He pretended to nothing, and studied the concealments of ambiguity more
in reality than in appearance. Constantia, however, discovered a
sufficient resemblance between their theories of virtue and duty. The
difference between them lay in the inferences arbitrarily deduced, and
in which two persons may vary without end, and yet never be repugnant.
Constantia delighted her companions by the facility with which she
entered into his meaning, the sagacity she displayed in drawing out his
hints, circumscribing his conjectures, and thwarting or qualifying his
maxims. The scene was generally replete with ardour and contention, and
yet the impression left on the mind of Ormond was full of harmony. Her
discourse tended to rouse him from his lethargy, to furnish him with
powerful excitements; and the time spent in her company seemed like a
doubling of existence.

The comparison could not but suggest itself between this scene and that
exhibited by Helena. With the latter, voluptuous blandishments, musical
prattle, and silent but expressive homage, composed a banquet delicious
fur awhile, but whose sweetness now began to pall upon his taste. It
supplied him with no new ideas, and hindered him, by the lulling
sensations it inspired, from profiting by his former acquisitions.
Helena was beautiful. Apply the scale, and not a member was found
inelegantly disposed, or negligently moulded. Not a curve that was
blemished by an angle or ruffled by asperities. The irradiations of her
eyes were able to dissolve the knottiest fibres, and their azure was
serene beyond any that nature had elsewhere exhibited. Over the rest of
her form the glistening and rosy hues were diffused with prodigal
luxuriance, and mingled in endless and wanton variety. Yet this image
had fewer attractions even to the senses than that of Constantia. So
great is the difference between forms animated by different degrees of
intelligence.

The interviews of Ormond and Constantia grew more frequent. The progress
which they made in acknowledgement of each other was rapid. Two
positions, that were favourite ones with him, were quickly subverted. He
was suddenly changed, from being one of the calumniators of the female
sex, to one of its warmest eulogists. This was a point on which
Constantia had ever been a vigorous disputant; but her arguments, in
their direct tendency, would never have made a convert of this man.
Their force, intrinsically considered, was nothing. He drew his
conclusions from incidental circumstances. Her reasonings might be
fallacious or valid, but they were composed, arranged, and delivered,
were drawn from such sources, and accompanied with such illustrations,
as plainly testified a manlike energy in the reasoner. In this indirect
and circuitous way her point was unanswerably established.

"Your reasoning is bad," he would say: "every one of your conclusions is
false. Not a single allegation but may be easily confuted; and yet I
allow that your position is incontrovertibly proved by them. How
bewildered is that man who never thinks for himself! who rejects a
principle merely because the arguments brought in support of it are
insufficient! I must not reject the truth because another has
unjustifiably adopted it. I want to reach a certain hill-top. Another
has reached it before me, but the ladder he used is too weak to bear me.
What then? Am I to stay below on that account? No; I have only to
construct one suitable to the purpose, and of strength sufficient."

A second maxim had never been confuted till now. It inculcated the
insignificance and hollowness of love. No pleasure he thought was to be
despised for its own sake. Every thing was good in its place, but
amorous gratifications were to be degraded to the bottom of the
catalogue. The enjoyments of music and landscape were of a much higher
order. Epicurism itself was entitled to more respect. Love, in itself,
was in his opinion of little worth, and only of importance as the source
of the most terrible of intellectual maladies. Sexual sensations
associating themselves, in a certain way, with our ideas, beget a
disease, which has, indeed, found no place in the catalogue, but is a
case of more entire subversion and confusion of mind than any other. The
victim is callous to the sentiments of honour and shame, insensible to
the most palpable distinctions of right and wrong, a systematic opponent
of testimony and obstinate perverter of truth.

Ormond was partly right. Madness like death can be averted by no
foresight or previous contrivance; This probably is one of its
characteristics. He that witnesses its influence on another with most
horror, and most fervently deprecates its ravages, is not therefore more
safe. This circumstance was realized in the history of Ormond.

This infatuation, if it may so be called, was gradual in its progress.
The sensations which Helena was now able to excite were of a new kind.
Her power was not merely weakened, but her endeavours counteracted their
own end. Her fondness was rejected with disdain, or borne with
reluctance. The lady was not slow in perceiving this change. The stroke
of death would have been more acceptable. His own reflections were too
tormenting to make him willing to discuss them in words. He was not
aware of the effects produced by this change in his demeanour, till
informed of it by herself.

One evening he displayed symptoms of uncommon dissatisfaction. Her
tenderness was unable to dispel it. He complained of want of sleep. This
afforded a hint which she drew forth in one of her enchanting ditties.
Habit had almost conferred upon her the power of spontaneous poesy, and,
while she pressed his forehead to her bosom, she warbled forth a strain
airy and exuberant in numbers, tender and ecstatic in its imagery:--

     Sleep, extend thy downy pinion
       Hasten from thy cell with speed;
     Spread around thy soft dominion;
       Much those brows thy balmy presence need.

     Wave thy wand of slumberous power,
       Moistened in Lethean dews,
     To charm the busy spirits of the hour,
       And brighten memory's malignant hues.

     Thy mantle, dark and starless, cast
       Over my selected youth;
     Bury in thy womb the mournful past,
       And soften with thy dreams th' asperities of truth.

     The changeful hues of his impassioned sleep,
       My office it shall be to watch the while;
     With thee, my love, when fancy prompts, to weep,
       And when thou smil'st, to smile.

     But sleep! I charge thee, visit not these eyes,
       Nor raise thy dark pavilion here,
     'Till morrow from the cave of ocean arise,
       And whisper tuneful joy in nature's ear.

     But mutely let me lie, and sateless gaze
       At all the soul that in his visage sits,
     While spirits of harmonious air--

Here her voice sunk, and the line terminated in a sigh. Her museful
ardours were chilled by the looks of Ormond. Absorbed in his own
thoughts, he appeared scarcely to attend to this strain. His sternness
was proof against her accustomed fascinations. At length she
pathetically complained of his coldness, and insinuated her suspicions
that his affection was transferred to another object. He started from
her embrace, and after two or three turns across the room, he stood
before her. His large eyes were steadfastly fixed upon her face.

"Aye," said he, "thou hast guessed right. The love, poor as it was, that
I had for thee, is gone: henceforth thou art desolate indeed. Would to
God thou wert wise. Thy woes are but beginning; I fear they will
terminate fatally; if so, the catastrophe cannot come too quickly.

"I disdain to appeal to thy justice, Helena, to remind thee of
conditions solemnly and explicitly assumed. Shall thy blood be upon thy
own head? No. I will bear it myself. Though the load would crush a
mountain, I will bear it.

"I cannot help it; I make not myself; I am moulded by circumstances;
whether I shall love thee or not is no longer in my own choice. Marriage
if indeed still in my power. I may give thee any name, and share with
thee my fortune. Will these content thee? Thou canst not partake of my
love. Thou canst have no part in my tenderness. These, are reserved for
another more worthy than thou.

"But no. Thy state is to the last degree forlorn, even marriage is
denied thee. Thou wast contented to take me without it,--to dispense
with the name of wife; but the being who has displaced thy image in thy
heart is of a different class. She will be to me a wife, or nothing; and
I must be her husband, or perish.

"Do not deceive thyself, Helena. I know what it is in which thou hast
placed thy felicity. Life is worth retaining by thee but on one
condition. I know the incurableness of thy infirmity; but be not
deceived. Thy happiness is ravished from thee. The condition on which
thou consentedst to live is annulled. I love thee no longer.

"No truth was ever more delicious; none was ever more detestable. I
fight against conviction, and I cling to it. That I love thee no longer
is at once a subject of joy, and of mourning. I struggle to believe
thee superior to this shock; that thou wilt be happy, though deserted by
me. Whatever be thy destiny, my reason will not allow me to be miserable
on that account. Yet I would give the world--I would forfeit every claim
but that which I hope upon the heart of Constantia--to be sure that thy
tranquillity will survive this stroke.

"But let come what will, look no longer to me for offices of love.
Henceforth all intercourse of tenderness ceases,--perhaps all personal
intercourse whatever. But though this good be refused, thou art sure of
independence. I will guard thy ease and thy honour with a father's
scrupulousness. Would to Heaven a sister could be created by adoption! I
am willing, for thy sake, to be an impostor. I will own thee to the
world for my sister, and carry thee whither the cheat shall never be
detected. I would devote my whole life to prevarication and falsehood
for thy sake, if that would suffice to make thee happy."

To this speech Helena had nothing to answer: her sobs and tears choked
all utterance. She hid her face with her handkerchief, and sat powerless
and overwhelmed with despair. Ormond traversed the room uneasily,
sometimes moving to and fro with quick steps, sometimes standing and
eyeing her with looks of compassion. At length he spoke:--

"It is time to leave you. This is the first night that you will spend in
dreary solitude. I know it will be sleepless and full of agony; but the
sentence cannot be recalled. Henceforth regard me as a brother. I will
prove myself one. All other claims are swallowed up in a superior
affection." In saying this, he left the house, and, almost without
intending it, found himself in a few minutes at Mr. Dudley's door.




CHAPTER VII.


The politeness of Melbourne had somewhat abated Mr. Dudley's aversion to
society. He allowed himself sometimes to comply with urgent invitations.
On this evening he happened to be at the house of that gentleman. Ormond
entered, and found Constantia alone. An interview of this kind was
seldom enjoyed, though earnestly wished for, by Constantia, who was
eager to renew the subject of her first conversation with Ormond. I have
already explained the situation of her mind. All her wishes were
concentred in the marriage of Helena. The eligibility of this scheme, in
every view which she took of it, appeared in a stronger light. She was
not aware that any new obstacle had arisen. She was free from the
consciousness of any secret bias. Much less did her modesty suspect
that she herself would prove an insuperable impediment to this plan.

There was more than usual solemnity in Ormond's demeanour. After he was
seated, he continued, contrary to his custom, to be silent. These
singularities were not unobserved by Constantia. They did not, however,
divert her from her purpose.

"I am glad to see you," said she. "We so seldom enjoy the advantage of a
private interview. I have much to say to you. You authorize me to
deliberate on your actions, and, in some measure, to prescribe to you.
This is a province which I hope to discharge with integrity and
diligence. I am convinced that Helena's happiness and your own can be
secured in one way only. I will emulate your candour, and come at once
to the point. Why have you delayed so long the justice that is due to
this helpless and lovely girl? There are a thousand reasons why you
should think of no other alternative. You have been pleased to repose
some degree of confidence in my judgement. Hear my full and deliberate
opinion. Make Helena your wife. This is the unequivocal prescription of
your duty."

This address was heard by Ormond without surprise; but his countenance
betrayed the acuteness of his feelings. The bitterness that overflowed
his heart was perceptible in his tone when he spoke:--

"Most egregiously are you deceived. Such is the line with which human
capacity presumes to fathom futurity. With all your discernment you do
not see that marriage would effectually destroy me. You do not see that,
whether beneficial or otherwise in its effects, marriage is impossible.
You are merely prompting me to suicide: but how shall I inflict the
wound? Where is the weapon? See you not that I am powerless? Leap, say
you, into the flames. See you not that I am fettered? Will a mountain
move at your bidding? Sooner than I in the path which you prescribe to
me."

This speech was inexplicable. She pressed him to speak less
enigmatically. Had he formed his resolution? If so, arguments and
remonstrances were superfluous. Without noticing her interrogatories, he
continued:--

"I am too hasty in condemning you. You judge, not against, but without
knowledge. When sufficiently informed, your decision will be right. Yet
how can you be ignorant? Can you for a moment contemplate yourself and
me, and not perceive an insuperable bar to this union?"

"You place me," said Constantia, "in a very disagreeable predicament. I
have not deserved this treatment from you. This is an unjustifiable
deviation from plain dealing. Of what impediment do you speak. I can
safely say that I know of none."

"Well," resumed he, with augmented eagerness, "I must supply you with
knowledge. I repeat, that I perfectly rely on the rectitude of your
judgement. Summon all your sagacity and disinterestedness and choose for
me. You know in what light Helena has been viewed by me. I have ceased
to view her in this light. She has become an object of indifference.
Nay, I am not certain that I do not hate her,--not indeed for her own
sake, but because I love another. Shall I marry her whom I hate, when
there exists one whom I love with unconquerable ardour?"

Constantia was thunderstruck with this intelligence. She looked at him
with some expression of doubt. "How is this?" said she. "Why did you not
tell me this before?"

"When I last talked with you on this subject I knew it not myself. It
has occurred since. I have seized the first occasion that has offered
to inform you of it. Say now, since such is my condition, ought Helena
to be my wife?"

Constantia was silent. Her heart bled for what she foresaw would be the
sufferings and forlorn destiny of Helena. She had not courage to inquire
further into this new engagement.

"I wait for your answer, Constantia. Shall I defraud myself of all the
happiness which would accrue from a match of inclination? Shall I put
fetters on my usefulness? This is the style in which you speak. Shall I
preclude all the good to others that would flow from a suitable
alliance? Shall I abjure the woman I love, and marry her whom I hate?"

"Hatred," replied the lady, "is a harsh word. Helena has not deserved
that you should hate her. I own this is a perplexing circumstance. It
would be wrong to determine hastily. Suppose you give yourself to
Helena: will more than yourself be injured by it? Who is this lady?
Will she be rendered unhappy by a determination in favour of another?
This is a point of the utmost importance."

At these words Ormond forsook his seat, and advanced close up to
Constantia:--"You say true. This is a point of inexpressible importance.
It would be presumption in me to decide. That is the lady's own
province. And now, say truly, are you willing to accept Ormond with all
his faults? Who but yourself could be mistress of all the springs of my
soul? I know the sternness of your probity. This discovery will only
make you more strenuously the friend of Helena. Yet why should you not
shun either extreme? Lay yourself out of view. And yet, perhaps the
happiness of Constantia is not unconcerned in this question. Is there no
part of me in which you discover your own likeness? Am I deceived, or is
it an incontrollable destiny that unites us?"

This declaration was truly unexpected by Constantia. She gathered from
it nothing but excitements of grief. After some pause she said:--"This
appeal to me has made no change in my opinion. I still think that
justice requires you to become the husband of Helena. As to me, do you
think my happiness rests upon so slight a foundation? I cannot love but
when my understanding points out to me the propriety of love. Ever since
I have known you I have looked upon you as rightfully belonging to
another. Love could not take place in my circumstances. Yet I will not
conceal from you my sentiments. I am not sure that, in different
circumstances, I should not have loved. I am acquainted with your worth.
I do not look for a faultless man. I have met with none whose blemishes
were fewer.

"It matters not, however, what I should have been. I cannot interfere,
in this case, with the claims of my friend. I have no passion to
struggle with. I hope, in every vicissitude, to enjoy your esteem, and
nothing more. There is but one way in which mine can be secured, and
that is by espousing this unhappy girl."

"No!" exclaimed Ormond. "Require not impossibilities. Helena can never
be any thing to me. I should, with unspeakably more willingness, assail
my own life."

"What," said the lady, "will Helena think of this sudden and dreadful
change? I cannot bear to think upon the feelings that this information
will excite."

"She knows it already. I have this moment left her. I explained to her,
in a few words, my motives, and assured her of my unalterable
resolution. I have vowed never to see her more but as a brother; and
this vow she has just heard."

Constantia could not suppress her astonishment and compassion at this
intelligence:--"No surely; you could not be so cruel! And this was done
with your usual abruptness, I suppose. Precipitate and implacable man!
Cannot you foresee the effects of this madness? You have planted a
dagger in her heart. You have disappointed me. I did not think you could
act so inhumanly."

"Nay, beloved Constantia, be not so liberal of your reproaches. Would
you have me deceive her? She must shortly have known it. Could the truth
be told too soon?"

"Much too soon," replied the lady, fervently. "I have always condemned
the maxims by which you act. Your scheme is headlong and barbarous.
Could not you regard with some little compassion that love that
sacrificed, for your unworthy sake, honest fame and the peace of virtue?
Is she not a poor outcast, goaded by compunction, and hooted at by a
malignant and misjudging world? And who was it that reduced her to this
deplorable condition? For whose sake did she willingly consent to brave
evils, by which the stoutest heart is appalled? Did this argue no
greatness of mind? Who ever surpassed her in fidelity and tenderness?
But thus has she been rewarded. I shudder to think what may be the
event. Her courage cannot possibly support her against treatment so
harsh, so perversely and wantonly cruel. Heaven grant that you are not
shortly made bitterly to lament this rashness!"

Ormond was penetrated with these reproaches. They persuaded him for a
moment that his deed was wrong; that he had not unfolded his intentions
to Helena with a suitable degree of gentleness and caution. Little more
was said on this occasion. Constantia exhorted him, in the most earnest
and pathetic manner, to return and recant, or extenuate, his former
declarations. He could not be brought to promise compliance. When he
parted from her, however, he was half resolved to act as she advised.
Solitary reflection made him change this resolution, and he returned to
his own house.

During the night he did little else than ruminate on the events of the
preceding evening. He entertained little doubt of his ultimate success
with Constantia. She gratified him in nothing, but left him every thing
to hope. She had hitherto, it seems, regarded him with indifference, but
this had been sufficiently explained. That conduct would be pursued, and
that passion be entertained, which her judgement should previously
approve. What then was the obstacle? It originated in the claims of
Helena. But what were these claims? It was fully ascertained that he
should never be united to this girl. If so, the end contemplated by
Constantia, and for the sake of which only his application was rejected,
could never be obtained. Unless her rejection of him could procure a
husband for her friend, it would, on her own principles, be improper and
superfluous.

What was to be done with Helena? It was a terrible alternative to which
he was reduced:--to marry her or see her perish. But was this
alternative quite sure? Could not she, by time or by judicious
treatment, be reconciled to her lot? It was to be feared that he had not
made a suitable beginning: and yet, perhaps it was most expedient that a
hasty and abrupt sentence should be succeeded by forbearance and lenity.
He regretted his precipitation, and though unused to the melting mood,
tears were wrung from him by the idea of the misery which he had
probably occasioned. He was determined to repair his misconduct as
speedily as possible, and to pay her a conciliating visit the next
morning.

He went early to her house. He was informed by the servant that her
mistress had not yet risen. "Was it usual," he asked, "for her to lie so
late?" "No," he was answered, "she never knew it happen before, but she
supposed her mistress was not well. She was just going into her chamber
to see what was the matter."

"Why," said Ormond, "do you suppose that she is sick?"

"She was poorly last night. About nine o'clock she sent out for some
physic to make her sleep."

"To make her sleep?" exclaimed Ormond, in a fettering and affrighted
accent.

"Yes: she said she wanted it for that. So I went to the 'pothecary's.
When I came back she was very poorly indeed. I asked her if I might not
sit up with her. 'No,' she said, 'I do not want anybody. You may go to
bed as soon as you please, and tell Fabian to do the same. I shall not
want you again.'"

"What did you buy?"

"Some kind of water,--laud'num I think they call it. She wrote it down,
and I carried the paper to Mr. Eckhart's, and he gave it to me in a
bottle, and I gave it to my mistress."

"'Tis well: retire: I will see how she is myself."

Ormond had conceived himself fortified against every disaster: he looked
for nothing but evil, and therefore, in ordinary cases, regarded its
approach without fear or surprise. Now, however, he found that his
tremors would not be stilled: his perturbations increased with every
step that brought him nearer to her chamber. He knocked, but no answer
was returned. He opened the door, advanced to the bed side, and drew
back the curtains. He shrunk from the spectacle that presented itself.
Was this the Helena that, a few hours before, was blithesome with health
and radiant with beauty? Her visage was serene, but sunken and pale.
Death was in every line of it. To his tremulous and hurried scrutiny
every limb was rigid and cold.

The habits of Ormond tended to obscure the appearances, if not to deaden
the emotions of sorrow. He was so much accustomed to the frustration of
well-intended efforts, and confided so much in his own integrity, that
he was not easily disconcerted. He had merely to advert, on this
occasion, to the tumultuous state of his feelings, in order to banish
their confusion and restore himself to calm. "Well," said he, as he
dropped the curtain and turned towards another part of the room, "this,
without doubt, is a rueful spectacle. Can it be helped? Is there in man
the power of recalling her? There is none such in me.

"She is gone: well then, she _is_ gone. If she were fool enough to die,
I am not fool enough to follow her. I am determined to live and be happy
notwithstanding. Why not?

"Yet, this is a piteous night. What is impossible to undo, might be
easily prevented. A piteous spectacle! But what else, on an ampler
scale, is the universe? Nature is a theatre of suffering. What corner
is unvisited by calamity and pain? I have chosen as became me. I would
rather precede thee to the grave, than live to be thy husband.

"Thou hast done my work for me. Thou hast saved thyself and me from a
thousand evils. Thou hast acted as seemed to thee best, and I am
satisfied.

"Hast thou decided erroneously? They that know thee need not marvel at
that. Endless have been the proofs of thy frailty. In favour of this
last act something may be said. It is the last thou wilt ever commit.
Others only will experience its effects; thou hast, at least, provided
for thy own safety.

"But what is here? A letter for me? Had thy understanding been as prompt
as thy fingers, I could have borne with thee. I can easily divine the
contents of this epistle."

He opened it, and found the tenor to be as follows:--

   "You did not use, my dear friend, to part with me in this manner.
   You never before treated me so roughly. I am, sorry, indeed I am,
   that I ever offended you. Could you suppose that I intended it? And
   if you knew that I meant not offence, why did you take offence?

   "I'm very unhappy, for I have lost you, my friend. You will never
   see me more, you say. That is very hard. I have deserved it
   to-be-sure, but I do not know how it has happened. Nobody more
   desired to please than I have done. Morning, noon, night, it was my
   only study; but you will love me no more; you will see me no more.
   Forgive me, my friend, but I must say it is very hard.

   "You said rightly; I do not wish to live without my friend. I have
   spent my life happily heretofore. 'Tis true, these have been
   transient uneasinesses, but your love was a reward and a cure for
   every thing. I desired nothing better in this world. Did you ever
   hear me murmur? No; I was not so unjust. My lot was happy,
   infinitely beyond my deserving. I merited not to be loved by you.
   Oh that I had suitable words to express my gratitude for your
   kindness! but this last meeting,--how different from that which
   went before? Yet even then there was something on your brow like
   discontent, which I could not warble nor whisper away as I used to
   do. But sad as this was, it was nothing like the last.

   "Could Ormond be so stern and so terrible? You knew that I would
   die, but you need not have talked as if I were in the way, and as
   if you had rather I should die than live. But one thing I rejoice
   at; I am a poor silly girl, but Constantia is a noble and
   accomplished one. Most joyfully do I resign you to her, my dear
   friend. You say you love her. She need not be afraid of accepting
   you. There will be no danger of your preferring another to her. It
   was very natural and very right for you to prefer her to me. She
   and you will be happy in each other. It is this that sweetens the
   cup I am going to drink. Never did I go to sleep with more
   good-will than I now go to death. Fare you well, my dear friend."

This letter was calculated to make a deeper impression on Ormond than
even the sight of Helena's corpse. It was in vain, for some time, that
he endeavoured to reconcile himself to this event. It was seldom that he
was able to forget it. He was obliged to exert all his energies to
enable him to support the remembrance. The task was of course rendered
easier by time.

It was immediately requisite to attend to the disposal of the corpse. He
felt himself unfit for this mournful office. He was willing to relieve
himself from it by any expedient. Helena's next neighbour was an old
lady, whose scruples made her shun all direct intercourse with this
unhappy girl; yet she had performed many acts of neighbourly kindness.
She readily obeyed the summons of Ormond, on this occasion, to take
charge of affairs till another should assert it. Ormond returned home,
and sent the following note to Constantia:--

   "You have predicted aright. Helena is dead. In a mind like your's
   every grief will be suspended, and every regard absorbed in the
   attention due to the remains of this unfortunate girl. _I_ cannot
   attend to them."

Constantia was extremely shocked by this intelligence, but she was not
unmindful of her duty. She prepared herself, with mournful alacrity, for
the performance of it. Every thing that the occasion demanded was done
with diligence and care. Till this was accomplished, Ormond could not
prevail upon himself to appear upon the stage. He was informed of this
by a note from Constantia, who requested him to take possession of the
unoccupied dwelling and its furniture.

Among the terms of his contract with Helena, Ormond had voluntarily
inserted the exclusive property of a house and its furniture in this
city, with funds adequate to her plentiful maintenance. These he had
purchased and transferred to her. To this he had afterwards added a
rural retreat, in the midst of spacious and well-cultivated fields,
three miles from Perth-Amboy, and seated on the right bank of the Sound.
It is proper to mention that this farm was formerly the property of Mr.
Dudley,--had been fitted up by him, and used as his summer abode during
his prosperity. In the division of his property it had fallen to one of
his creditors, from whom it had been purchased by Ormond. This
circumstance, in conjunction with the love which she bore to Constantia,
had suggested to Helena a scheme, which her want of foresight would, in
different circumstances, have occasioned her to overlook. It was that of
making her testament, by which she bequeathed all that she possessed to
her friend. This was not done without the knowledge and cheerful
concurrence of Ormond, who, together with Melbourne and another
respectable citizen, were named executors. Melbourne and his friend were
induced by their respect for Constantia to consent to this nomination.

This had taken place before Ormond and Constantia had been introduced to
each other. After this event, Ormond had sometimes been employed in
contriving means for securing to his new friend and her father a
subsistence, more certain than the will of Helena could afford. Her
death he considered as an event equally remote and undesirable. This
event, however unexpectedly, had now happened, and precluded the
necessity of further consideration on this head.

Constantia could not but accept this bequest. Had it been her wish to
decline it, it was not in her power, but she justly regarded the
leisure and independence thus conferred upon her, as inestimable
benefits. It was a source of unbounded satisfaction on her father's
account, who was once more seated in the bosom of affluence. Perhaps, in
a rational estimate, one of the most fortunate events that could have
befallen those persons, was that period of adversity through which they
had been doomed to pass. Most of the defects that adhered to the
character of Mr. Dudley, had, by this means, been exterminated. He was
now cured of those prejudices which his early prosperity had instilled,
and which had flowed from luxurious indigencies. He had learned to
estimate himself at his true value, and to sympathize with sufferings
which he himself had partaken.

It was easy to perceive in what light Constantia was regarded by her
father. He never reflected on his relation to her without rapture. Her
qualities were the objects of his adoration. He resigned himself with
pleasure to her guidance. The chain of subordination and duties was
reversed. By the ascendancy of her genius and wisdom the province of
protection and the tribute of homage had devolved upon her. This had
resulted from incessant experience of the wisdom of her measures, and
the spectacle of her fortitude and skill in every emergency.

It seemed as if but one evil adhered to the condition of this man. His
blindness was an impediment to knowledge and enjoyment, of which, the
utmost to be hoped was, that he should regard it without pungent regret,
and that he should sometimes forget it; that his mind should
occasionally stray into foreign paths, and lose itself in sprightly
conversations, or benign reveries. This evil, however, was by no means
remediless.

A surgeon of uncommon skill had lately arrived from Europe. He was one
of the numerous agents and dependants of Ormond and had been engaged to
abdicate his native country for purposes widely remote from his
profession. The first use that was made of him was to introduce him to
Mr. Dudley. The diseased organs were critically examined, and the
patient was, with considerable difficulty, prevailed upon to undergo the
necessary operation. His success corresponded with Constantia's wishes,
and her father was once more restored to the enjoyment of light.

These were auspicious events. Constantia held herself amply repaid by
them for all that she had suffered. These sufferings had indeed been
light, when compared with the effects usually experienced by others in a
similar condition. Her wisdom had extracted its sting from adversity,
and without allowing herself to feel much of the evils of its reign,
had employed it as an instrument by which the sum of her present
happiness was increased. Few suffered less in the midst of poverty, than
she. No one ever extracted more felicity from the prosperous reverse.




CHAPTER VIII.


When time had somewhat mitigated the memory of the late disaster, the
intercourse between Ormond and Constantia was renewed. The lady did not
overlook her obligations to her friend. It was to him that she was
indebted for her father's restoration to sight, and to whom both owed,
essentially, though indirectly, their present affluence. In her mind,
gratitude was no perverse or ignoble principle. She viewed this man as
the author of extensive benefits, of which her situation enabled her to
judge with more accuracy than others. It created no bias on her
judgement, or, at least, none of which she was sensible. Her equity was
perfectly unfettered; and she decided in a way contrary to his
inclination, with as little scruple as if the benefits had been
received, not by herself, but by him. She indeed intended his benefit,
though she thwarted his inclinations.

She had few visitants beside himself. Their interviews were daily and
unformal. The fate of Helena never produced any reproaches on her part.
She saw the uselessness of recrimination, not only because she desired
to produce emotions different from those which infective is adapted to
excite, but because it was more just to soothe than to exasperate the
inquietudes which haunted him.

She now enjoyed leisure. She had always been solicitous for mental
improvement. Any means subservient to this end were valuable. The
conversation of Ormond was an inexhaustible fund. By the variety of
topics and the excitement to reflection it supplied, a more plenteous
influx of knowledge was produced than could have flowed from any other
source. There was no end to the detailing of facts, and the canvassing
of theories.

I have already said that Ormond was engaged in schemes of an arduous and
elevated nature. These were the topics of epistolary discussion between
him and a certain number of coadjutors, in different parts of the world.
In general discourse, it was proper to maintain a uniform silence
respecting these, not only because they involved principles and views
remote from vulgar apprehension, but because their success, in some
measure, depended on their secrecy. He could not give a stronger proof
of his confidence in the sagacity and steadiness of Constantia than he
now gave, by imparting to her his schemes, and requesting her advice and
assistance in the progress of them.

His disclosures, however, were imperfect. What knowledge was imparted,
instead of appeasing, only tended to inflame her curiosity. His answers
to her inquiries were prompt, and, at first sight, sufficiently
explicit; but upon reconsideration, an obscurity seemed to gather round
them, to be dispelled by new interrogatories. These, in like manner,
effected a momentary purpose, but were sure speedily to lead into new
conjectures, and reimmerse her in doubts. The task was always new, was
always on the point of being finished, and always to be recommenced.

Ormond aspired to nothing more ardently than to hold the reins of
opinion,--to exercise absolute power over the conduct of others, not by
constraining their limbs, or by exacting obedience to his authority, but
in a way of which his subjects should be scarcely conscious. He desired
that his guidance should control their steps, but that his agency, when
most effectual, should be least suspected.

If he were solicitous to govern the thoughts of Constantia, or to
regulate her condition, the mode which he pursued had hitherto been
admirably conducive to that end. To have found her friendless and
indigent, accorded, with the most fortunate exactness, with his views.
That she should have descended to this depth, from a prosperous height,
and therefore be a stranger to the torpor which attends hereditary
poverty, and be qualified rightly to estimate and use the competence to
which, by this means, she was now restored, was all that his providence
would have prescribed.

Her thoughts were equally obsequious to his direction. The novelty and
grandeur of his schemes could not fail to transport a mind ardent and
capacious as that of Constantia. Here his fortune had been no less
propitious. He did not fail to discover, and was not slow to seize, the
advantages flowing thence. By explaining his plans, opportunity was
furnished to lead and to confine her meditations to the desirable tract.
By adding fictitious embellishments, he adapted it with more exactness
to his purpose. By piecemeal and imperfect disclosures her curiosity
was kept alive.

I have described Ormond at having contracted a passion for Constantia.
This passion certainly existed in his heart, but it must not be
conceived to be immutable, or to operate independently of all those
impulses and habits which time had interwoven in his character. The
person and affections of this woman were the objects sought by him, and
which it was the dearest purpose of his existence to gain. This was his
supreme good, though the motives to which it was indebted for its
pre-eminence in his imagination were numerous and complex.

I have enumerated his opinions on the subject of wedlock. The question
will obviously occur, whether Constantia was sought by him with upright
or flagitious views. His sentiments and resolution on this head had for
a time fluctuated, but were now steadfast. Marriage was, in his eyes,
hateful and absurd as ever. Constantia was to be obtained by any means.
If other terms were rejected, he was willing, for the sake of this good,
to accept her as a wife; but this was a choice to be made only when
every expedient was exhausted for reconciling her to a compact of a
different kind.

For this end he, prescribed to himself a path suited to the character of
this lady. He made no secret of his sentiments and views. He avowed his
love, and described, without scruple, the scope of his wishes. He
challenged her to confute his principles, and promised a candid audience
and profound consideration to her arguments. Her present opinions he
knew to be adverse to his own, but he hoped to change them by subtlety
and perseverance. His further hopes and designs he concealed from her.
She was unaware that if he were unable to effect a change in her creed,
he was determined to adopt a system of imposture,--to assume the guise
of a convert to her doctrines, and appear as devout as herself in his
notions of the sanctity of marriage.

Perhaps it was not difficult to have foreseen the consequence of these
projects. Constantia's peril was imminent. This arose not only from the
talents and address of Ormond, but from the community of sentiment which
already existed between them. She was unguarded in a point where, if not
her whole yet doubtless her principal security and strongest bulwark
would have existed. She was unacquainted with religion. She was
unhabituated to conform herself to any standard but that connected with
the present life. Matrimonial as well as every other human duty, was
disconnected in her mind with any awful or divine sanction. She formed
her estimate of good and evil on nothing but terrestrial and visible
consequences.

This defect in her character she owed to her father's system of
education. Mr. Dudley was an adherent to what he conceived to be true
religion. No man was more passionate in his eulogy of his own form of
devotion and belief, or in his invectives against atheistical dogmas;
but he reflected that religion assumed many forms, one only of which is
salutary or true, and that truth in this respect is incompatible with
infantile and premature instruction.

To this subject it was requisite to apply the force of a mature and
unfettered understanding. For this end he laboured to lead away the
juvenile reflections of Constantia from religious topics, to detain them
in the paths of history and eloquence,--to accustom her to the accuracy
of geometrical deduction, and to the view of those evils that have
flowed in all ages, from mistaken piety.

In consequence of this scheme, her habits rather than her opinions, were
undevout. Religion was regarded by her not with disbelief, but with
absolute indifference. Her good sense forbade her to decide before
inquiry, but her modes of study and reflection were foreign to, and
unfitted her for this species of discussion. Her mind was seldom called
to meditate on this subject, and when it occurred, her perceptions were
vague and obscure. No objects, in the sphere which she occupied, were
calculated to suggest to her the importance of investigation and
certainty.

It becomes me to confess, however reluctantly, thus much concerning my
friend. However abundantly endowed in other respects, she was a stranger
to the felicity and excellence flowing from religion. In her struggles
with misfortune, she was supported and cheered by the sense of no
approbation but her own. A defect of this nature will perhaps be
regarded as of less moment when her extreme youth is remembered. All
opinion in her mind were mutable, inasmuch as the progress of her
understanding was incessant.

It was otherwise with Ormond. His disbelief was at once unchangeable and
strenuous. The universe was to him a series of events, connected by an
undesigning and inscrutable necessity, and an assemblage of forms, to
which no beginning or end can be conceived. Instead of transient views
and vague ideas, his meditations, on religious points, had been intense.
Enthusiasm was added to disbelief, and he not only dissented but
abhorred.

He deemed it prudent, however, to disguise sentiments which, if unfolded
in their full force, would wear to her the appearance of insanity. But
he saw and was eager to improve the advantage which his anti-nuptial
creed derived from the unsettled state of her opinions. He was not
unaware, likewise, of the auspicious and indispensable co-operation of
love. If this advocate were wanting in her bosom, all his efforts would
be in vain. If this pleader were engaged in his behalf, he entertained
no doubts of his ultimate success. He conceived that her present
situation, all whose comforts were the fruits of his beneficence, and
which afforded her no other subject of contemplation than himself, was
as favourable as possible to the growth of this passion.

Constantia was acquainted with his wishes. She could not fail to see
that she might speedily be called upon to determine a momentous
question. Her own sensations, and the character of Ormond were,
therefore, scrutinized with suspicious attention. Marriage could be
justified in her eyes only by community of affections and opinions. She
might love without the sanction of her judgement; but, while destitute
of that sanction, she would never suffer it to sway her conduct.

Ormond was imperfectly known. What knowledge she had gained flowed
chiefly from his own lips, and was therefore unattended with certainty.
What portion of deceit or disguise was mixed with his conversation could
be known only by witnessing his actions with her own eyes and comparing
his testimony with that of others. He had embraced a multitude of
opinions which appeared to her erroneous. Till these were rectified, and
their conclusions were made to correspond, wedlock was improper. Some of
these obscurities might be dispelled, and some of these discords be
resolved into harmony by time. Meanwhile it was proper to guard the
avenues to her heart, and screen herself from self-delusion.

There was no motive to conceal her reflections on this topic from her
father. Mr. Dudley discovered, without her assistance, the views of
Ormond. His daughter's happiness was blended with his own. He lived but
in the consciousness of her tranquillity. Her image was seldom absent
from his eyes, and never from his thoughts. The emotions which it
excited sprung but in part from the relationship of father. It was
gratitude and veneration which she claimed from him, and which filled
him with rapture.

He ruminated deeply on the character of Ormond. The political and
anti-theological tenets of this man were regarded, not merely with
disapprobation, but antipathy. He was not ungrateful for the benefits
which had been conferred upon him. Ormond's peculiarities of sentiment
excited no impatience, as long as he was regarded merely as a visitant.
It was only as one claiming to possess his daughter that his presence
excited, in Mr. Dudley, trepidation and loathing.

Ormond was unacquainted with what was passing in the mind of Mr. Dudley.
The latter conceived his own benefactor and his daughter's friend to be
entitled to the most scrupulous and affable urbanity. His objections to
a nearer alliance were urged with frequent and pathetic vehemence only
in his private interviews with Constantia. Ormond and he seldom met. Mr.
Dudley, as soon as his sight was perfectly retrieved, betook himself
with eagerness to painting,--an amusement which his late privations had
only contributed to endear to him.

Things remained nearly on their present footing for some months. At the
end of this period some engagement obliged Ormond to leave the city. He
promised to return with as much speed as circumstances would admit.
Meanwhile, his letters supplied her with topics of reflection. These
were frequently received, and were models of that energy of style which
results from simplicity of structure, from picturesque epithets, and
from the compression of much meaning into few words. His arguments
seldom imparted conviction, but delight never failed to flow from their
lucid order and cogent brevity. His narratives were unequalled for
rapidity and comprehensiveness. Every sentence was a treasury to
moralists and painters.




CHAPTER IX.


Domestic and studious occupations did not wholly engross the attention
of Constantia. Social pleasures were precious to her heart, and she was
not backward to form fellowships and friendships with those around her.
Hitherto she had met with no one entitled to an uncommon portion of
regard, or worthy to supply the place of the friend of her infancy. Her
visits were rare, and, as yet, chiefly confined to the family of Mr.
Melbourne. Here she was treated with flattering distinctions, and
enjoyed opportunities of extending as far as she pleased her connections
with the gay and opulent. To this she felt herself by no means inclined,
and her life was still eminently distinguished by love of privacy and
habits of seclusion.

One morning, feeling an indisposition to abstraction, she determined to
drop in, for an hour, on Mrs. Melbourne. Finding Mrs. Melbourne's
parlour unoccupied, she proceeded unceremoniously to an apartment on the
second floor, where that lady was accustomed to sit. She entered, but
this room was likewise empty. Here she cast her eyes on a collection of
prints, copied from the Farnese collection, and employed herself for
some minutes in comparing the forms of Titiano and the Caracchi.

Suddenly, notes of peculiar sweetness were wafted to her ear from
without. She listened with surprise, for the tones of her father's lute
were distinctly recognized. She hied to the window, which chanced to
look into a back court. The music was perceived to come from the window
of the next house. She recollected her interview with the purchaser of
her instrument at the music shop, and the powerful impression which the
stranger's countenance had made upon her.

The first use she had made of her recent change of fortune was to
endeavour to recover this instrument. The music dealer, when reminded of
the purchase, and interrogated as to the practicability of regaining the
lute, for which she was willing to give treble the price, answered that
he had no knowledge of the foreign lady beyond what was gained at the
interview which took place in Constantia's presence. Of her name,
residence, and condition, he knew nothing, and had endeavoured in vain
to acquire knowledge.

Now, this incident seemed to have furnished her with the information she
had so earnestly sought. This performer was probably the stranger
herself. Her residence so near the Melbournes, and in a house which was
the property of the magistrate, might be means of information as to her
condition, and perhaps of introduction to a personal acquaintance.

While engaged in these reflections, Mrs. Melbourne entered the
apartment. Constantia related this incident to her friend, and stated
the motives of her present curiosity. Her friend willingly imparted what
knowledge she possessed relative to this subject. This was the sum.

This house had been hired, previously to the appearance of the yellow
fever, by an English family, who left their native soil with a view to a
permanent abode in the new world. They had scarcely taken possession of
the dwelling when they were terrified by the progress of the epidemic.
They had fled from the danger; but this circumstance, in addition to
some others, induced them to change their scheme. An evil so unwonted as
pestilence impressed them with a belief of perpetual danger as long as
they remained on this side of the ocean. They prepared for an immediate
return to England.

For this end their house was relinquished, and their splendid furniture
destined to be sold by auction. Before this event could take place,
application was made to Mr. Melbourne by a lady whom his wife's
description showed to be the same person of whom Constantia was in
search. She not only rented the house, but negotiated by means of her
landlord for the purchase of the furniture.

Her servants were blacks, and all but one, who officiated as steward,
unacquainted with the English language. Some accident had proved her
name to be Beauvais. She had no visitants, very rarely walked abroad,
and then only in the evening with a female servant in attendance. Her
hours appeared to be divided between the lute and the pen. As to her
previous history or her present sources of subsistence, Mrs.
Melbourne's curiosity had not been idle, but no consistent information
was obtainable. Some incidents had given birth to the conjecture that
she was wife, or daughter, or sister of Beauvais, the partizan of
Brissot, whom the faction of Marat had lately consigned to the scaffold;
but this conjecture was unsupported by suitable evidence.

This tale by no means diminished Constantia's desire of personal
intercourse. She saw no means of effecting her purpose. Mrs. Melbourne
was unqualified to introduce her, having been discouraged in all the
advances she had made towards a more friendly intercourse. Constantia
reflected, that her motives to seclusion would probably induce this lady
to treat others as her friend had been treated.

It was possible, however, to gain access to her, if not as a friend, yet
as the original proprietor of the lute. She determined to employ the
agency of Roseveldt, the music-shopman, for the purpose of rebuying
this instrument. To enforce her application, she commissioned this
person, whose obliging temper entitled him to confidence, to state her
inducements for originally offering it for sale, and her motives for
desiring the repossession on any terms which the lady thought proper to
dictate.

Roseveldt fixed an hour in which it was convenient for him to execute
her commission. This hour having passed, Constantia, who was anxious
respecting his success, hastened to his house. Roseveldt delivered the
instrument, which the lady, having listened to his pleas and offers,
directed to be gratuitously restored to Constantia. At first, she had
expressed her resolution to part with it on no account, and at no price.
Its music was her only recreation, and this instrument surpassed any she
had ever before seen, in the costliness and delicacy of its workmanship.
But Roseveldt's representations produced an instant change of
resolution, and she not only eagerly consented to restore it, but
refused to receive any thing in payment.

Constantia was deeply affected by this unexpected generosity. It was not
her custom to be outstripped in this career. She now condemned herself
for her eagerness to regain this instrument. During her father's
blindness it was a powerful, because the only, solace of his melancholy.
Now he had no longer the same anxieties to encounter, and books and the
pencil were means of gratification always at hand. The lute therefore,
she imagined, could be easily dispensed with by Mr. Dudley, whereas its
power of consoling might be as useful to the unknown lady as it had
formerly been to her father. She readily perceived in what manner it
became her to act. Roseveldt was commissioned to redeliver the lute, and
to entreat the lady's acceptance of it. The tender was received without
hesitation, and Roseveldt dismissed without any inquiry relative to
Constantia.

These transactions were reflected on by Constantia with considerable
earnestness. The conduct of the stranger, her affluent and lonely slate,
her conjectural relationship to the actors in the great theatre of
Europe, were mingled together in the fancy of Constantia, and
embellished with the conceptions of her beauty derived from their casual
meeting at Roseveldt's. She forgot not their similitude in age and sex,
and delighted to prolong the dream of future confidence and friendship
to take place between them. Her heart sighed for a companion fitted to
partake in all her sympathies.

This strain, by being connected with the image of a being like herself,
who had grown up with her from childhood, who had been entwined with her
earliest affections, but from whom she had been severed from the period
at which her father's misfortunes commenced, and of whose present
condition she was wholly ignorant, was productive of the deepest
melancholy. It filled her with excruciating, and, for a time,
irremediable sadness. It formed a kind of paroxysm, which, like some
febrile affections, approach and retire without warning, and against the
most vehement struggles.

In this mood her fancy was thronged with recollections of scenes in
which her friend had sustained a part. Their last interview was commonly
revived in her remembrance so forcibly as almost to produce a lunatic
conception of its reality. A ditty which they sung together on that
occasion flowed to her lips. If ever human tones were qualified to
convey the whole soul, they were those of Constantia when she sang:--

     "The breeze awakes, the bark prepares,
       To waft me to a distant shore:
     But far beyond this world of cares
       We meet again to part no more."

These fits were accustomed to approach and to vanish by degrees. They
were transitory, but not unfrequent, and were pregnant with such
agonizing tenderness, such heart-breaking sighs, and a flow of such
bitter yet delicious tears, that it were not easily decided whether the
pleasure or the pain surmounted. When symptoms of their coming were felt
she hastened into solitude, that the progress of her feelings might
endure no restraint.

On the evening of the day on which the lute had been sent to the foreign
lady, Constantia was alone in her chamber immersed in desponding
thoughts. From these she was recalled by Fabian, her black servant, who
announced a guest. She was loath to break off the thread of her present
meditations, and inquired with a tone of some impatience, who was the
guest. The servant was unable to tell; it was a young lady whom he had
never before seen; she had opened the door herself, and entered the
parlour without previous notice.

Constantia paused at this relation. Her thoughts had recently been fixed
upon Sophia Westwyn. Since their parting four years before she had heard
no tidings of this woman. Her fears imagined no more probable cause of
her friend's silence than her death. This, however, was uncertain. The
question now occurred, and brought with it sensations that left her no
power to move:--was this the guest?

Her doubts were quickly dispelled, for the stranger taking a light from
the table, and not brooking the servant's delays, followed Fabian to the
chamber of his mistress. She entered with careless freedom, and
presented to the astonished eyes of Constantia the figure she had met at
Roseveldt's, and the purchaser of her lute.

The stranger advanced towards her with quick steps, and mingling tones
of benignity and sprightliness, said:--

"I have come to perform a duty. I have received from you to-day a lute
that I valued almost as my best friend. To find another in America,
would not, perhaps, be possible; but, certainly, none equally superb and
exquisite as this can be found. To show how highly I esteem the gift, I
have come in person to thank you for it."--There she stopped.

Constantia could not suddenly recover from the extreme surprise into
which the unexpectedness of this meeting had thrown her. She could
scarcely sufficiently suppress this confusion to enable her to reply to
these rapid effusions of her visitant, who resumed with augmented
freedom:--

"I came, as I said, to thank you, but to say the truth that was not all,
I came likewise to see you. Having done my errand, I suppose I must go.
I would fain stay longer and talk to you a little. Will you give me
leave?"

Constantia, scarcely retrieving her composure, stammered out a polite
assent. They seated themselves, and the visitant, pressing the hand she
had taken, proceeded in a strain so smooth, so flowing, sliding from
grave to gay, blending vivacity with tenderness, interpreting
Constantia's silence with such keen sagacity, and accounting for the
singularities of her own deportment in a way so respectful to her
companion, and so worthy of a steadfast and pure mind in herself, that
every embarrassment and scruple were quickly banished from their
interview.

In an hour the guest took her leave. No promise of repeating her visit,
and no request that Constantia would repay it, was made. Their parting
seemed to be the last; whatever purpose having been contemplated
appeared to be accomplished by this transient meeting. It was of a
nature deeply to interest the mind of Constantia. This was the lady who
talked with Roseveldt, and bargained with Melbourne, and they had been
induced by appearances to suppose her ignorant of any language but
French; but her discourse, on the present occasion, was in English, and
was distinguished by unrivalled fluency. Her phrases and habits of
pronouncing were untinctured by any foreign mixture, and bespoke the
perfect knowledge of a native of America.

On the next evening, while Constantia was reviewing this transaction,
calling up and weighing the sentiments which the stranger had uttered,
and indulging some regret at the unlikelihood of their again meeting,
Martinette (for I will henceforth call her by her true name) entered the
apartment as abruptly as before. She accounted for the visit merely by
the pleasure it afforded her, and proceeded in a strain even more
versatile and brilliant than before. This interview ended like the
first, without any tokens on the part of the guest, of resolution or
desire to renew it; but a third interview took place on the ensuing day.

Henceforth Martinette became a frequent but hasty visitant, and
Constantia became daily more enamoured of her new acquaintance. She did
not overlook peculiarities in the conversation and deportment of this
woman. These exhibited no tendencies to confidence or traces of
sympathy. They merely denoted large experience, vigorous faculties, and
masculine attainments. Herself was never introduced, except as an
observer; but her observations on government and manners were profound
and critical.

Her education seemed not widely different from that which Constantia had
received. It was classical and mathematical; but to this was added a
knowledge of political and military transactions in Europe during the
present age, which implied the possession of better means of information
than books. She depicted scenes and characters with the accuracy of one
who had partaken and witnessed them herself.

Constantia's attention had been chiefly occupied by personal concerns.
Her youth had passed in contention with misfortune, or in the quietudes
of study. She could not be unapprised of contemporary revolutions and
wars, but her ideas concerning them were indefinite and vague. Her views
and her inferences on this head were general and speculative. Her
acquaintance with history was exact and circumstantial, in proportion as
she retired backward from her own age. She knew more of the siege of
Mutina than that of Lisle; more of the machinations of Cataline and the
tumults of Clodius, than of the prostration of the Bastile, and the
proscriptions of Marat.

She listened, therefore, with unspeakable eagerness to this reciter, who
detailed to her, as the occasion suggested, the progress of action and
opinion on the theatre of France and Poland. Conceived and rehearsed as
this was with the energy and copiousness of one who sustained a part in
the scene, the mind of Constantia was always kept at the pitch of
curiosity and wonder.

But, while this historian described the features, personal deportment,
and domestic character of Antoinette, Mirabeau and Robespierre, an
impenetrable veil was drawn over her own condition. There was a warmth
and freedom in her details, which bespoke her own co-agency in these
events, but was unattended by transports of indignation or sorrow, or by
pauses of abstraction, such as were likely to occur in one whose hopes
and fears had been intimately blended with public events.

Constantia could not but derive humiliation from comparing her own
slender acquirements with those of her companion. She was sensible that
all the differences between them arose from diversities of situation.
She was eager to discover in what particulars this diversity consisted.
She was for a time withheld, by scruples not easily explained, from
disclosing her wishes. An accident, however, occurred to remove these
impediments. One evening this unceremonious visitant discovered
Constantia busily surveying a chart of the Mediterranean Sea. This
circumstance led the discourse to the present state of Syria and Cyprus.
Martinette was copious in her details. Constantia listened for a time;
and, when a pause ensued, questioned her companion as to the means she
possessed of acquiring so much knowledge. This question was proposed
with diffidence, and prefaced by apologies.

"Instead of being offended by your question," replied the guest, "I only
wonder that it never before occurred to you. Travellers tell us much.
Volney and Mariti would have told you nearly all that I have told. With
these I have conversed personally, as well as read their books; but my
knowledge is, in truth, a species of patrimony. I inherit it."

"Will you be good enough," said Constantia, "to explain yourself?"

"My mother was a Greek of Cyprus. My father was a Slavonian of Ragusa,
and I was born in a garden at Aleppo."

"That was a singular concurrence."

"How singular? That a nautical vagrant like my father should sometimes
anchor in the Bay of Naples; that a Cyprian merchant should carry his
property and daughter beyond the reach of a Turkish sangjack, and seek
an asylum so commodious as Napoli; that my father should have dealings
with this merchant, see, love, and marry his daughter, and afterwards
procure from the French government a consular commission to Aleppo; that
the union should in due time be productive of a son and daughter,--are
events far from being singular. They happen daily."

"And may I venture to ask if this be your history?"

"The history of my parents. I hope you do not consider the place of my
birth as the sole or the most important circumstance of my life."

"Nothing would please me more than to be enabled to compare it with
other incidents. I am apt to think that your life is a tissue of
surprising events. That the daughter of a Ragusan and Greek should have
seen and known so much; that she should talk English with equal fluency
and more correctness than a native; that I should now be conversing with
her in a corner so remote from Cyprus and Sicily, are events more
wonderful than any which I have known."

"Wonderful! Pish! Thy ignorance, thy miscalculation of probabilities is
far more so. My father talked to me in Slavonic; my mother and her maids
talked to me in Greek. My neighbours talked to me in a medley of Arabic,
Syriac, and Turkish. My father's secretary was a scholar. He was as well
versed in Lysias and Xenophon as any of their contemporaries. He
laboured for ten years to enable me to read a language essentially the
same with that I used daily to my nurse and mother. Is it wonderful then
that I should be skilful in Slavonic, Greek, and the jargon of Aleppo?
To have refrained from learning was impossible. Suppose, a girl, prompt,
diligent, inquisitive, to spend ten years of her life partly in Spain,
partly in Tuscany, partly in France, and partly in England. With her
versatile curiosity and flexible organs would it be possible For her to
remain ignorant of each of these languages? Latin is the mother of them
all, and presents itself of course to her studious attention."

"I cannot easily conceive motives which should lead you before the age
of twenty through so many scenes."

"Can you not? You grew and flourished, like a frail mimosa, in the spot
where destiny had planted you. Thank my stars, I am somewhat better than
a vegetable. Necessity, it is true, and not choice, set me in motion,
but I am not sorry for the consequences."

"Is it too much," said Constantia, with some hesitation, "to request a
detail of your youthful adventures?"

"Too much to give, perhaps, at a short notice. To such as you my tale
might abound with novelty, while to others, more acquainted with
vicissitudes, it would be tedious and flat. I must be gone in a few
minutes. For that and for better reasons, I must not be minute. A
summary at present will enable you to judge how far a more copious
narrative is suited to instruct or to please you."

CHAPTER I.


"My father, in proportion as he grew old and rich, became weary of
Aleppo. His natal soil, had it been the haunt of Calmucks or Bedouins,
his fancy would have transformed into Paradise. No wonder that the
equitable aristocracy and the peaceful husbandmen of Ragusa should be
endeared to his heart by comparison with Egyptian plagues and Turkish
tyranny. Besides, he lived for his children as well as himself. Their
education and future lot required him to seek a permanent home.

"He embarked, with his wife and offspring, at Scanderoon. No immediate
conveyance to Ragusa offering, the appearance of the plague in Syria
induced him to hasten his departure. He entered a French vessel for
Marseilles. After being three days at sea, one of the crew was seized by
the fatal disease which had depopulated all the towns upon the coast.
The voyage was made with more than usual despatch; but, before we
reached our port, my mother and half the crew perished. My father died
in the Lazaretto, more through grief than disease.

"My brother and I were children and helpless. My father's fortune was on
board this vessel, and was left by his death to the mercy of the
captain. This man was honest, and consigned us and our property to the
merchant with whom he dealt. Happily for us, our protector was childless
and of scrupulous integrity. We henceforth became his adopted children.
My brother's education and my own were conducted on the justest
principles.

"At the end of four years, our protector found it expedient to make a
voyage to Cayenne. His brother was an extensive proprietor in that
colony, but his sudden death made way for the succession of our friend.
To establish his claims, his presence was necessary on the spot. He was
little qualified for arduous enterprises, and his age demanded repose;
but, his own acquisitions having been small, and being desirous of
leaving us in possession of competence, he cheerfully embarked.

"Meanwhile, my brother was placed at a celebrated seminary in the Pays
de Vaud, and I was sent to a sister who resided at Verona. I was at this
time fourteen years old,--one year younger than my brother, whom, since
that period, I have neither heard of nor seen.

"I was now a woman, and qualified to judge and act for myself. The
character of my new friend was austere and devout, and there were so
many incongenial points between us that but little tranquillity was
enjoyed under her control. The priest who discharged the office of her
confessor thought proper to entertain views with regard to me, grossly
inconsistent with the sanctity of his profession. He was a man of
profound dissimulation and masterly address. His efforts, however, were
repelled with disdain. My security against his attempts lay in the
uncouthness and deformity which nature had bestowed upon his person and
visage, rather than in the firmness of my own principles.

"The courtship of Father Bartoli, the austerities of Madame Roselli, the
disgustful or insipid occupations to which I was condemned, made me
impatiently wish for a change; but my father (so I will call him) had
decreed that I should remain under his sister's guardianship till his
return from Guiana. When this would happen was uncertain. Events
unforeseen might protract it for years, but it could not arrive in less
than a twelvemonth.

"I was incessantly preyed upon by discontent. My solitude was loathsome.
I panted after liberty and friendship, and the want of these were not
recompensed by luxury and quiet, and by the instructions in useful
science which I received from Bartoli, who, though detested as a
hypocrite and lover, was venerable as a scholar. He would fain have been
an Abelard, but it was not his fate to meet with an Eloisa.

"Two years passed away in this durance. My miseries were exquisite. I am
almost at a loss to account for the unhappiness of that time, for,
looking back upon it, I perceive that an equal period could not have
been spent with more benefit. For the sake of being near me, Bartoli
importunately offered his instructions. He had nothing to communicate
but metaphysics and geometry. These were little to my taste, but I could
not keep him at a distance. I had no other alternative than to endure
him as a lover or a teacher. His passion for science was at least equal
to that which ho entertained for me, and both these passions combined to
make him a sedulous instructor. He was a disciple of the newest
doctrines respecting matter and mind. He denied the impenetrability of
the first, and the immateriality of the second. These he endeavoured to
inculcate upon me, as well as to subvert my religious tenets, because he
delighted, like all men, in transfusing his opinions, and because he
regarded my piety as the only obstacle to his designs. He succeeded in
dissolving the spell of ignorance, but not in producing that kind of
acquiescence he wished. He had, in this respect, to struggle not only
with my principles, but my weakness. He might have overcome every
obstacle but my abhorrence of deformity and age. To cure me of this
aversion was beyond his power. My servitude grew daily more painful. I
grew tired of chasing a comet to its aphelion, and of untying the knot
of an infinite series. A change in my condition became indispensable to
my very existence. Languor and sadness, and unwillingness to eat or to
move, were at last my perpetual attendants!

"Madame Roselli was alarmed at my condition. The sources of my
inquietude were incomprehensible to her. The truth was, that I scarcely
understood them myself, and my endeavours to explain them to my friend
merely instilled into her an opinion that I was either lunatic or
deceitful. She complained and admonished; but my disinclination to my
usual employments would not be conquered, and my health rapidly
declined. A physician, who was called, confessed that my case was beyond
his power to understand, but recommended, as a sort of desperate
expedient, a change of scene. A succession and variety of objects might
possibly contribute to my cure.

"At this time there arrived, at Verona, Lady D'Arcy,--an Englishwoman
of fortune and rank, and a strenuous Catholic. Her husband had lately
died; and, in order to divert her grief, as well as to gratify her
curiosity in viewing the great seat of her religion, she had come to
Italy. Intercourse took place between her and Madame Roselli. By this
means she gained a knowledge of my person and condition, and kindly
offered to take me under her protection. She meant to traverse every
part of Italy, and was willing that I should accompany her in all her
wanderings.

"This offer was gratefully accepted, in spite of the artifices and
remonstrances of Bartoli. My companion speedily contracted for me the
affection of a mother. She was without kindred of her own religion,
having acquired her faith, not by inheritance, but conversion. She
desired to abjure her native country, and to bind herself, by every
social tie, to a people who adhered to the same faith. Me she promised
to adopt as her daughter, provided her first impressions in my favour
were not belied by my future deportment.

"My principles were opposite to hers; but habit, an aversion to
displease my friend, my passion for knowledge, which my new condition
enabled me to gratify, all combined to make me a deceiver. But my
imposture was merely of a negative kind; I deceived her rather by
forbearance to contradict, and by acting as she acted, than by open
assent and zealous concurrence. My new state was, on this account, not
devoid of inconvenience. The general deportment and sentiments of Lady
D'Arcy testified a vigorous and pure mind. New avenues to knowledge, by
converse with mankind and with books, and by the survey of new scenes,
were open for my use. Gratitude and veneration attached me to my friend,
and made the task of pleasing her, by a seeming conformity of
sentiments, less irksome.

"During this interval, no tidings were received by his sister, at
Verona, respecting the fate of Sebastian Roselli. The supposition of
his death was too plausible not to be adopted. What influence this
disaster possessed over my brother's destiny, I know not. The generosity
of Lady D'Arcy hindered me from experiencing any disadvantage from this
circumstance. Fortune seemed to have decreed that I should not be
reduced to the condition of an orphan.

"At an age and in a situation like mine, I could not remain long
unacquainted with love. My abode at Rome introduced me to the knowledge
of a youth from England, who had every property which I regarded as
worthy of esteem. He was a kinsman of--Lady D'Arcy, and as such admitted
at her house on the most familiar footing. His patrimony was extremely
slender, but was in his own possession. He had no intention of
increasing it by any professional pursuit, but was contented with the
frugal provision it afforded. He proposed no other end of his existence
than the acquisition of virtue and knowledge.

"The property of Lady D'Arcy was subject to her own disposal, but, on
the failure of a testament, this youth was, in legal succession, the
next heir. He was well acquainted with her temper and views, but, in the
midst of urbanity and gentleness, studied none of those concealments of
opinion which would have secured him her favour. That he was not of her
own faith was an insuperable, but the only, obstacle to the admission of
his claims.

"If conformity of age and opinions, and the mutual fascination of love,
be a suitable basis for marriage, Wentworth and I were destined for each
other. Mutual disclosure added sanctity to our affection; but, the
happiness of Lady D'Arcy being made to depend upon the dissolution of
our compact, the heroism of Wentworth made him hasten to dissolve it. As
soon as she discovered our attachment, she displayed symptoms of the
deepest anguish. In addition to religious motives, her fondness for me
forbade her to exist but in my society and in the belief of the purity
of my faith. The contention, on my part, was vehement between the
regards due to her felicity and to my own. Had Wentworth left me the
power to decide, my decision would doubtless have evinced the frailty of
my fortitude and the strength of my passion; but, having informed me
fully of the reasons of his conduct, he precipitately retired from Rome.
He left me no means of tracing his footsteps and of assailing his
weakness by expostulation and entreaty.

"Lady D'Arcy was no less eager to abandon a spot where her happiness had
been so imminently endangered. Our next residence was Palermo. I will
not dwell upon the sensations produced by this disappointment in me. I
review them with astonishment and self-compassion. If I thought it
possible for me to sink again into imbecility so ignominious, I should
be disposed to kill myself.

"There was no end to vows of fondness and tokens of gratitude in Lady
D'Arcy. Her future life should be devoted to compensate me for this
sacrifice. Nothing could console her in that single state in which she
intended to live, but the consolations of my fellowship. Her conduct
coincided for some time with these professions, and my anguish was
allayed by the contemplation of the happiness conferred upon one whom I
revered.

"My friend could not be charged with dissimulation and artifice. Her
character had been mistaken by herself as well as by me. Devout
affections seemed to have filled her heart, to the exclusion of any
object besides myself. She cherished with romantic tenderness the memory
of her husband, and imagined that a single state was indispensably
enjoined upon her by religious duty. This persuasion, however, was
subverted by the arts of a Spanish cavalier, young, opulent, and
romantic as herself in devotion. An event like this might, indeed, have
been easily predicted, by those who reflected that the lady was still in
the bloom of life, ardent in her temper, and bewitching in her manners.

"The fondness she had lavished upon me was now, in some degree,
transferred to a new object; but I still received the treatment due to a
beloved daughter. She was solicitous as ever to promote my
gratification, and a diminution of kindness would not have been
suspected by those who had not witnessed the excesses of her former
passion. Her marriage with the Spaniard removed the obstacle to union
with Wentworth. This man, however, had set himself beyond the reach of
my inquiries. Had there been the shadow of a clue afforded me, I should
certainly have sought him to the ends of the world.

"I continued to reside with my friend, and accompanied her and her
husband to Spain. Antonio de Leyva was a man of probity. His mind was
enlightened by knowledge and his actions dictated by humanity. Though
but little older than myself, and young enough to be the son of his
spouse, his deportment to me was a model of rectitude and delicacy. I
spent a year in Spain, partly in the mountains of Castile and partly at
Segovia. New manners and a new language occupied my attention for a
time; but these, losing their novelty, lost their power to please. I
betook myself to books, to beguile the tediousness and diversify the
tenor of my life.

"This would not have long availed; but I was relieved from new
repinings, by the appointment of Antonio de Leyva to a diplomatic office
at Vienna. Thither we accordingly repaired. A coincidence of
circumstances had led me wide from the path of ambition and study
usually allotted to my sex and age. From the computation of eclipses, I
now betook myself to the study of man. My proficiency, when I allowed it
to be seen, attracted great attention. Instead of adulation and
gallantry, I was engaged in watching the conduct of states and revolving
the theories of politicians.

"Superficial observers were either incredulous with regard to my
character, or connected a stupid wonder with their belief. My
attainments and habits they did not see to be perfectly consonant with
the principles of human nature. They unavoidably flowed from the illicit
attachment of Bartoli, and the erring magnanimity of Wentworth. Aversion
to the priest was the grand inciter of my former studies; the love of
Wentworth, whom I hoped once more to meet, made me labour to exclude the
importunities of others, and to qualify myself for securing his
affections.

"Since our parting in Italy, Wentworth had traversed Syria and Egypt,
and arrived some months after me at Vienna. He was on the point of
leaving the city, when accident informed me of his being there. An
interview was effected, and, our former sentiments respecting each other
having undergone no change, we were united. Madame de Leyva reluctantly
concurred with our wishes, and, at parting, forced upon me a
considerable sum of money.

"Wentworth's was a character not frequently met with in the world. He
was a political enthusiast, who esteemed nothing more graceful or
glorious than to die for the liberties of mankind. He had traversed
Greece with an imagination full of the exploits of ancient times, and
derived, from contemplating Thermopylæ and Marathon, an enthusiasm that
bordered upon frenzy.

"It was now the third year of the Revolutionary War in America, and,
previous to our meeting at Vienna, he had formed the resolution of
repairing thither and tendering his service to the Congress as a
volunteer. Our marriage made no change in his plans. My soul was
engrossed by two passions,--a wild spirit of adventure, and a boundless
devotion to him. I vowed to accompany him in every danger, to vie with
him in military ardour, to combat and to die by his side.

"I delighted to assume the male dress, to acquire skill at the sword,
and dexterity in every boisterous exercise. The timidity that commonly
attends women gradually vanished. I felt as if imbued by a soul that was
a stranger to the sexual distinction. We embarked at Brest, in a frigate
destined for St. Domingo. A desperate conflict with an English ship in
the Bay of Biscay was my first introduction to a scene of tumult and
danger of whose true nature I had formed no previous conception. At
first I was spiritless and full of dismay. Experience, however,
gradually reconciled me to the life that I had chosen.

"A fortunate shot, by dismasting the enemy, allowed us to prosecute our
voyage unmolested. At Cape François we found a ship which transported
us, after various perils, to Richmond, in Virginia. I will not carry you
through the adventures of four years. You, sitting all your life in
peaceful corners, can scarcely imagine that variety of hardship and
turmoil which attends the female who lives in a camp.

"Few would sustain these hardships with better grace than I did. I could
seldom be prevailed on to remain at a distance, and inactive, when my
husband was in battle, and more than once rescued him from death by the
seasonable destruction of his adversary.

"At the repulse of the Americans at Germantown, Wentworth was wounded
and taken prisoner. I obtained permission to attend his sick-bed and
supply that care without which he would assuredly have died. Being
imperfectly recovered, he was sent to England and subjected to a
rigorous imprisonment. Milder treatment might have permitted his
complete restoration to health; but, as it was, he died.

"His kindred were noble, and rich, and powerful; but it was difficult to
make them acquainted with Wentworth's situation. Their assistance, when
demanded, was readily afforded; but it came too late to prevent his
death. Me they snatched from my voluntary prison, and employed every
friendly art to efface from my mind the images of recent calamity.

"Wentworth's singularities of conduct and opinion had estranged him at
an early age from his family. They felt little regret at his fate, but
every motive concurred to secure their affection and succour to me. My
character was known to many officers, returned from America, whose
report, joined with the influence of my conversation, rendered me an
object to be gazed at by thousands. Strange vicissitude! Now immersed in
the infection of a military hospital, the sport of a wayward fortune,
struggling with cold and hunger, with negligence and contumely. A month
after, passing into scenes of gayety and luxury, exhibited at operas and
masquerades, made the theme of inquiry and encomium at every place of
resort, and caressed by the most illustrious among the votaries of
science and the advocates of the American cause.

"Here I again met Madame de Leyva. This woman was perpetually assuming
new forms. She was a sincere convert to the Catholic religion, but she
was open to every new impression. She was the dupe of every powerful
reasoner, and assumed with equal facility the most opposite shapes. She
had again reverted to the Protestant religion, and, governed by a
headlong zeal in whatever cause she engaged, she had sacrificed her
husband and child to a new conviction.

"The instrument of this change was a man who passed, at that time, for a
Frenchman. He was young, accomplished, and addressful, but was not
suspected of having been prompted by illicit views, or of having seduced
the lady from allegiance to her husband as well as to her God. De Leyva,
however, who was sincere in his religion as well as his love, was hasty
to avenge this injury, and, in a contest with the Frenchman, was killed.
His wife adopted at once her ancient religion and country, and was once
more an Englishwoman.

"At our meeting her affection for me seemed to be revived, and the most
passionate entreaties were used to detain me in England. My previous
arrangements would not suffer it. I foresaw restraints and
inconveniences from the violence and caprice of her passions, and
intended henceforth to keep my liberty inviolate by any species of
engagement, either of friendship or marriage. My habits were French, and
I proposed henceforward to take up my abode at Paris. Since his voyage
to Guiana, I had heard no tidings of Sebastian Roselli. This man's image
was cherished with filial emotions, and I conceived that the sight of
him would amply reward a longer journey than from London to Marseilles.

"Beyond my hopes, I found him in his ancient abode. The voyage, and a
residence of three years at Cayenne, had been beneficial to his
appearance and health. He greeted me with paternal tenderness, and
admitted me to a full participation of his fortune, which the sale of
his American property had greatly enhanced. He was a stranger to the
fate of my brother. On his return home he had gone to Switzerland, with
a view of ascertaining his destiny. The youth, a few months after his
arrival at Lausanne, had eloped with a companion, and had hitherto
eluded all Roselli's searches and inquiries. My father was easily
prevailed upon to transfer his residence from Provence to Paris."

Here Martinette paused, and, marking the clock, "It is time," resumed
she, "to begone. Are you not weary of my tale? On the day I entered
France, I entered the twenty-third year of my age, so that my promise of
detailing my youthful adventures is fulfilled. I must away. Till we meet
again, farewell."




CHAPTER II.


Such was the wild series of Martinette's adventures. Each incident
fastened on the memory of Constantia, and gave birth to numberless
reflections. Her prospect of mankind seemed to be enlarged, on a sudden,
to double its ancient dimensions. Ormond's narratives had carried her
beyond the Mississippi, and into the deserts of Siberia. He had
recounted the perils of a Russian war, and painted the manners of
Mongols and Naudowessies. Her new friend had led her back to the
civilized world and portrayed the other half of the species. Men, in
their two forms of savage and refined, had been scrutinized by these
observers; and what was wanting in the delineations of the one was
liberally supplied by the other.

Eleven years in the life of Martinette was unrelated. Her conversation
suggested the opinion that this interval had been spent in France. It
was obvious to suppose that a woman thus fearless and sagacious had not
been inactive at a period like the present, which called forth talents
and courage without distinction of sex, and had been particularly
distinguished by female enterprise and heroism. Her name easily led to
the suspicion of concurrence with the subverters of monarchy, and of
participation in their fall. Her flight from the merciless tribunals of
the faction that now reigned would explain present appearances.

Martinette brought to their next interview an air of uncommon
exultation. On this being remarked, she communicated the tidings of the
fall of the sanguinary tyranny of Robespierre. Her eyes sparkled, and
every feature was pregnant with delight, while she unfolded, with her
accustomed energy, the particulars of this tremendous revolution. The
blood which it occasioned to flow was mentioned without any symptoms of
disgust or horror.

Constantia ventured to ask if this incident was likely to influence her
own condition.

"Yes. It will open the way for my return."

"Then you think of returning to a scene of so much danger?"

"Danger, my girl? It is my element. I am an adorer of liberty, and
liberty without peril can never exist."

"But so much bloodshed and injustice! Does not your heart shrink from
the view of a scene of massacre and tumult, such as Paris has lately
exhibited and will probably continue to exhibit?"

"Thou talkest, Constantia, in a way scarcely worthy of thy good sense.
Have I not been three years in a camp? What are bleeding wounds and
mangled corpses, when accustomed to the daily sight of them for years?
Am I not a lover of liberty? and must I not exult in the fall of
tyrants, and regret only that my hand had no share in their
destruction?"

"But a woman--how can the heart of woman be inured to the shedding of
blood?"

"Have women, I beseech thee, no capacity to reason and infer? Are they
less open than men to the influence of habit? My hand never faltered
when liberty demanded the victim. If thou wert with me at Paris, I could
show thee a fusil of two barrels, which is precious beyond any other
relic, merely because it enabled me to kill thirteen officers at
Jemappe. Two of these were emigrant nobles, whom I knew and loved before
the Revolution, but the cause they had since espoused cancelled their
claims to mercy."

"What!" said the startled Constantia; "have you fought in the ranks?"

"Certainly. Hundreds of my sex have done the same. Some were impelled by
the enthusiasm of love, and some by a mere passion for war; some by the
contagion of example; and some--with whom I myself must be ranked--by a
generous devotion to liberty. Brunswick and Saxe-Coburg had to contend
with whole regiments of women,--regiments they would have formed, if
they had been collected into separate bodies.

"I will tell thee a secret. Thou wouldst never have seen Martinette de
Beauvais, if Brunswick had deferred one day longer his orders for
retreating into Germany."

"How so?"

"She would have died by her own hand."

"What could lead to such an outrage?"

"The love of liberty."

"I cannot comprehend how that love should prompt you to suicide."

"I will tell thee. The plan was formed, and could not miscarry. A woman
was to play the part of a banished Royalist, was to repair to the
Prussian camp, and to gain admission to the general. This would have
easily been granted to a female and an ex-noble. There she was to
assassinate the enemy of her country, and to attest her magnanimity by
slaughtering herself. I was weak enough to regret the ignominious
retreat of the Prussians, because it precluded the necessity of such a
sacrifice."

This was related with accents and looks that sufficiently attested its
truth. Constantia shuddered, and drew back, to contemplate more
deliberately the features of her guest. Hitherto she had read in them
nothing that bespoke the desperate courage of a martyr and the deep
designing of an assassin. The image which her mind had reflected from
the deportment of this woman was changed. The likeness which she had,
feigned to herself was no longer seen. She felt that antipathy was
preparing to displace love. These sentiments, however, she concealed,
and suffered the conversation to proceed.

Their discourse now turned upon the exploits of several women who
mingled in the tumults of the capital and in the armies on the
frontiers. Instances were mentioned of ferocity in some, and magnanimity
in others, which almost surpassed belief. Constantia listened greedily,
though not with approbation, and acquired, at every sentence, new desire
to be acquainted with the personal history of Martinette. On mentioning
this wish, her friend said that she endeavoured to amuse her exile by
composing her own memoirs, and that, on her next visit, she would bring
with her the volume, which she would suffer Constantia to read.

A separation of a week elapsed. She felt some impatience for the renewal
of their intercourse, and for the perusal of the volume that had been
mentioned. One evening Sarah Baxter, whom Constantia had placed in her
own occasional service, entered the room with marks of great joy and
surprise, and informed her that she at length had discovered Miss
Monrose. From her abrupt and prolix account, it appeared that Sarah had
overtaken Miss Monrose in the street, and, guided by her own curiosity,
as well as by the wish to gratify her mistress, she had followed the
stranger. To her utter astonishment, the lady had paused at Mr. Dudley's
door, with a seeming resolution to enter it, but presently resumed her
way. Instead of pursuing her steps farther, Sarah had stopped to
communicate this intelligence to Constantia. Having delivered her news,
she hastened away, but, returning, in a moment, with a countenance of
new surprise, she informed her mistress that on leaving the house she
had met Miss Monrose at the door, on the point of entering. She added
that the stranger had inquired for Constantia, and was now waiting
below.

Constantia took no time to reflect upon an incident so unexpected and so
strange, but proceeded forthwith to the parlour. Martinette only was
there. It did not instantly occur to her that this lady and Mademoiselle
Monrose might possibly be the same. The inquiries she made speedily
removed her doubts, and it now appeared that the woman about whose
destiny she had formed so many conjectures and fostered so much anxiety
was no other than the daughter of Roselli.

Having readily answered her questions, Martinette inquired, in her turn,
into the motives of her friend's curiosity. These were explained by a
succinct account of the transactions to which the deceased Baxter had
been a witness. Constantia concluded with mentioning her own reflections
on the tale, and intimating her wish to be informed how Martinette had
extricated herself from a situation so calamitous.

"Is there any room for wonder on that head?" replied the guest. "It was
absurd to stay longer in the house. Having finished the interment of
Roselli, (soldier-fashion,) for he was the man who suffered his foolish
regrets to destroy him, I forsook the house. Roselli was by no means
poor, but he could not consent to live at ease, or to live at all, while
his country endured such horrible oppressions, and when so many of his
friends had perished. I complied with his humour, because it could not
be changed, and I revered him too much to desert him."

"But whither," said Constantia, "could you seek shelter at a time like
that? The city was desolate, and a wandering female could scarcely be
received under any roof. All inhabited houses were closed at that hour,
and the fear of infection would have shut them against you if they had
not been already so."

"Hast thou forgotten that there were at that time at least ten thousand
French in this city, fugitives from Marat and from St. Domingo? That
they lived in utter fearlessness of the reigning disease,--sung and
loitered in the public walks, and prattled at their doors, with all
their customary unconcern? Supposest thou that there were none among
these who would receive a countrywoman, even if her name had not been
Martinette de Beauvais? Thy fancy has depicted strange things; but
believe me that, without a farthing and without a name, I should not
have incurred the slightest inconvenience. The death of Roselli I
foresaw, because it was gradual in its approach, and was sought by him
as a good. My grief, therefore, was exhausted before it came, and I
rejoiced at his death, because it was the close of all his sorrows. The
rueful pictures of my distress and weakness which were given by Baxter
existed only in his own fancy."

Martinette pleaded an engagement, and took her leave, professing to have
come merely to leave with her the promised manuscript. This interview,
though short, was productive of many reflections on the deceitfulness of
appearances, and on the variety of maxims by which the conduct of human
beings is regulated. She was accustomed to impart all her thoughts and
relate every new incident to her father. With this view she now hied to
his apartment. This hour it was her custom, when disengaged, always to
spend with him.

She found Mr. Dudley busy in revolving a scheme which various
circumstances had suggested and gradually conducted to maturity. No
period of his life had been equally delightful with that portion of his
youth which he had spent in Italy. The climate, the language, the
manners of the people, and the sources of intellectual gratification in
painting and music, were congenial to his taste. He had reluctantly
forsaken these enchanting seats, at the summons of his father, but, on
his return to his native country, had encountered nothing but ignominy
and pain. Poverty and blindness had beset his path, and it seemed as if
it were impossible to fly too far from the scene of his disasters. His
misfortunes could not be concealed from others, and every thing around
him seemed to renew the memory of all that he had suffered. All the
events of his youth served to entice him to Italy, while all the
incidents of his subsequent life concurred to render disgustful his
present abode.

His daughter's happiness was not to be forgotten. This he imagined would
be eminently promoted by the scheme. It would open to her new avenues to
knowledge. It would snatch her from the odious pursuit of Ormond, and,
by a variety of objects and adventures, efface from her mind any
impression which his dangerous artifices might have made upon it.

This project was now communicated to Constantia. Every argument adapted
to influence her choice was employed. He justly conceived that the only
obstacle to her adoption of it related to Ormond. He expatiated on the
dubious character of this man, the wildness of his schemes, and the
magnitude of his errors. What could be expected from a man, half of
whose life had been spent at the head of a band of Cossacks, spreading
devastation in the regions of the Danube, and supporting by flagitious
intrigues the tyranny of Catharine, and the other half in traversing
inhospitable countries, and extinguishing what remained of clemency and
justice by intercourse with savages?

It was admitted that his energies were great, but misdirected, and that
to restore them to the guidance of truth was not in itself impossible;
but it was so with relation to any power that she possessed. Conformity
would flow from their marriage, but this conformity was not to be
expected from him. It was not his custom to abjure any of his doctrines
or recede from any of his claims. She knew likewise the conditions of
their union. She must go with him to some corner of the world where his
boasted system was established. What was the road to it he had carefully
concealed, but it was evident that it lay beyond the precincts of
civilized existence.

Whatever were her ultimate decision, it was at least proper to delay it.
Six years were yet wanting of that period at which only she formerly
considered marriage as proper. To all the general motives for deferring
her choice, the conduct of Ormond superadded the weightiest. Their
correspondence might continue, but her residence in Europe and converse
with mankind might enlighten her judgement and qualify her for a more
rational decision.

Constantia was not uninfluenced by these reasonings. Instead of
reluctantly admitting them, she somewhat wondered that they had not been
suggested by her own reflections. Her imagination anticipated her
entrance on that mighty scene with emotions little less than rapturous.
Her studies had conferred a thousand ideal charms on a theatre where
Scipio and Cæsar had performed their parts. Her wishes were no less
importunate to gaze upon the Alps and Pyrenees, and to vivify and
chasten the images collected from books, by comparing them with their
real prototypes.

No social ties existed to hold her to America. Her only kinsman and
friend would be the companion of her journeys. This project was likewise
recommended by advantages of which she only was qualified to judge.
Sophia Westwyn had embarked, four years previous to this date, for
England, in company with an English lady and her husband. The
arrangements that were made forbade either of the friends to hope for a
future meeting. Yet now, by virtue of this project, this meeting seemed
no longer to be hopeless.

This burst of new ideas and now hopes on the mind of Constantia took
place in the course of a single hour. No change in her external
situation had been wrought, and yet her mind had undergone the most
signal revolution. Tho novelty as well as greatness of the prospect kept
her in a state of elevation and awe, more ravishing than any she had
ever experienced. Anticipations of intercourse with nature in her most
august forms, with men in diversified states of society, with the
posterity of Greeks and Romans, and with the actors that were now upon
the stage, and, above all, with the being whom absence and the want of
other attachments had, in some sort, contributed to deify, made this
night pass away upon the wings of transport.

The hesitation which existed on parting with her father speedily gave
place to an ardour impatient of the least delay. She saw no impediments
to the immediate commencement of the voyage. To delay it a month, or
even a week, seemed to be unprofitable tardiness. In this ferment of her
thoughts, she was neither able nor willing to sleep. In arranging the
means of departure and anticipating the events that would successively
arise, there was abundant food for contemplation.

She marked the first dawnings of the day, and rose. She felt reluctance
to break upon her father's morning slumbers, but considered that her
motives were extremely urgent, and that the pleasure afforded him by her
zealous approbation of his scheme would amply compensate him for this
unseasonable intrusion on his rest. She hastened therefore to his
chamber. She entered with blithesome steps, and softly drew aside the
curtain.




CHAPTER III.


Unhappy Constantia! At the moment when thy dearest hopes had budded
afresh, when the clouds of insecurity and disquiet had retired from thy
vision, wast thou assailed by the great subverter of human schemes. Thou
sawest nothing in futurity but an eternal variation and succession of
delights. Thou wast hastening to forget dangers and sorrows which thou
fondly imaginedst were never to return. This day was to be the outset of
a new career; existence was henceforth to be embellished with enjoyments
hitherto scarcely within the reach of hope.

Alas! thy predictions of calamity seldom failed to be verified. Not so
thy prognostics of pleasure. These, though fortified by every
calculation of contingencies, were edifices grounded upon nothing. Thy
life was a struggle with malignant destiny,--a contest for happiness in
which thou wast fated to be overcome.

She stooped to kiss the venerable cheek of her father, and, by
whispering, to break his slumber. Her eye was no sooner fixed upon his
countenance, than she started back and shrieked. She had no power to
forbear. Her outcries were piercing and vehement. They ceased only with
the cessation of breath. She sunk upon a chair in a state partaking more
of death than of life, mechanically prompted to give vent to her agonies
in shrieks, but incapable of uttering a sound.

The alarm called her servants to the spot. They beheld her dumb, wildly
gazing, and gesticulating in a way that indicated frenzy. She made no
resistance to their efforts, but permitted them to carry her back to her
own chamber. Sarah called upon her to speak, and to explain the cause
of these appearances; but the shock which she had endured seemed to have
irretrievably destroyed her powers of utterance.

The terrors of the affectionate Sarah were increased. She kneeled by the
bedside of her mistress, and, with streaming eyes, besought the unhappy
lady to compose herself. Perhaps the sight of weeping in another
possessed a sympathetic influence, or nature had made provision for this
salutary change. However that be, a torrent of tears now came to her
succour, and rescued her from a paroxysm of insanity which its longer
continuance might have set beyond the reach of cure.

Meanwhile, a glance at his master's countenance made Fabian fully
acquainted with the nature of the scene. The ghastly visage of Mr.
Dudley showed that he was dead, and that he had died in some terrific
and mysterious manner. As soon as this faithful servant recovered from
surprise, the first expedient which his ingenuity suggested was to fly
with tidings of this event to Mr. Melbourne. That gentleman instantly
obeyed the summons. With the power of weeping, Constantia recovered the
power of reflection. This, for a time, served her only as a medium of
anguish. Melbourne mingled his tears with hers, and endeavoured, by
suitable remonstrances, to revive her fortitude.

The filial passion is perhaps instinctive to man; but its energy is
modified by various circumstances. Every event in the life of Constantia
contributed to heighten this passion beyond customary bounds. In the
habit of perpetual attendance on her father, of deriving from him her
knowledge, and sharing with him the hourly fruits of observation and
reflection, his existence seemed blended with her own. There was no
other whose concurrence and council she could claim, with whom a
domestic and uninterrupted alliance could be maintained. The only bond
of consanguinity was loosened, the only prop of friendship was taken
away.

Others, perhaps, would have observed that her father's existence had
been merely a source of obstruction and perplexity; that she had
hitherto acted by her own wisdom, and would find, hereafter, less
difficulty in her choice of schemes, and fewer impediments to the
execution. These reflections occurred not to her. This disaster had
increased, to an insupportable degree, the vacancy and dreariness of her
existence. The face she was habituated to behold had disappeared
forever; the voice whose mild and affecting tones had so long been
familiar to her ears was hushed into eternal silence. The felicity to
which she clung was ravished away; nothing remained to hinder her from
sinking into utter despair.

The first transports of grief having subsided, a source of consolation
seemed to be opened in the belief that her father had only changed one
form of being for another; that he still lived to be the guardian of her
peace and honour, to enter the recesses of her thought, to forewarn her
of evil and invite her to good. She grasped at these images with
eagerness, and fostered them as the only solaces of her calamity. They
were not adapted to inspire her with cheerfulness, but they sublimed her
sensations, and added an inexplicable fascination to sorrow.

It was unavoidable sometimes to reflect upon the nature of that death
which had occurred. Tokens were sufficiently apparent that outward
violence had been the cause. Who could be the performer of so black a
deed, by what motives he was guided, were topics of fruitless
conjecture. She mused upon this subject, not from the thirst of
vengeance, but from a mournful curiosity. Had the perpetrator stood
before her and challenged retribution, she would not have lifted a
finger to accuse or to punish. The evil already endured left her no
power to concert and execute projects for extending that evil to others.
Her mind was unnerved, and recoiled with loathing from considerations of
abstract justice, or political utility, when they prompted to the
prosecution of the murderer.

Melbourne was actuated by different views, but on this subject he was
painfully bewildered. Mr. Dudley's deportment to his servants and
neighbours was gentle and humane. He had no dealings with the
trafficking or labouring part of mankind. The fund which supplied his
cravings of necessity or habit was his daughter's. His recreations and
employments were harmless and lonely. The evil purpose was limited to
his death, for his chamber was exactly in the same state in which
negligent security had left it. No midnight footstep or voice, no
unbarred door or lifted window, afforded tokens of the presence or
traces of the entrance or flight of the assassin.

The meditations of Constantia, however, could not fail in some of their
circuities to encounter the image of Craig. His agency in the
impoverishment of her father, and in the scheme by which she had like to
have been loaded with the penalties of forgery, was of an impervious and
unprecedented kind. Motives were unveiled by time, in some degree
accounting for his treacherous proceeding; but there was room to suppose
an inborn propensity to mischief. Was he not the author of this new
evil? His motives and his means were equally inscrutable, but their
inscrutability might flow from her own defects in discernment and
knowledge, and time might supply her defects in this as in former
instances.

These images were casual. The causes of the evil were seldom
contemplated. Her mind was rarely at liberty to wander from reflection
on her irremediable loss. Frequently, when confused by distressful
recollections, she would detect herself going to her father's chamber.
Often his well-known accents would ring in her ears, and the momentary
impulse would be to answer his calls. Her reluctance to sit down to her
meals without her usual companion could scarcely be surmounted.

In this state of mind, the image of the only friend who survived, or
whose destiny, at least, was doubtful, occurred to her. She sunk into
fits of deeper abstraction and dissolved away in tears of more agonizing
tenderness. A week after her father's interment, she shut herself up in
her chamber, to torment herself with fruitless remembrances. The name of
Sophia Westwyn was pronounced, and the ditty that solemnized their
parting was sung. Now, more than formerly, she became sensible of the
loss of that portrait which had been deposited in the hands of M'Crea as
a pledge. As soon as her change of fortune had supplied her with the
means of redeeming it, she hastened to M'Crea for that end. To her
unspeakable disappointment, he was absent from the city; he had taken a
long journey, and the exact period of his return could not be
ascertained. His clerks refused to deliver the picture, or even, by
searching, to discover whether it was still in their master's
possession. This application had frequently and lately been repeated,
but without success; M'Crea had not yet returned, and his family were
equally in the dark as to the day on which his return might be expected.

She determined, on this occasion, to renew her visit. Her incessant
disappointments had almost extinguished hope, and she made inquiries at
his door, with a faltering accent and sinking heart. These emotions were
changed into surprise and delight, when answer was made that he had just
arrived. She was instantly conducted into his presence.

The countenance of M'Crea easily denoted that his visitant was by no
means acceptable. There was a mixture of embarrassment and sullenness in
his air, which was far from being diminished when the purpose of this
visit was explained. Constantia reminded him of the offer and acceptance
of this pledge, and of the conditions with which the transaction was
accompanied.

He acknowledged, with some hesitation, that a promise had been given to
retain the pledge until it were in her power to redeem it; but the long
delay, the urgency of his own wants, and particularly the ill treatment
which he conceived himself to have suffered in the transaction
respecting the forged note, had, in his own opinion, absolved him from
this promise. He had therefore sold the picture to a goldsmith, for as
much as the gold about it was worth.

This information produced, in the heart of Constantia, a contest between
indignation and sorrow, that for a time debarred her from speech. She
stifled the anger that was, at length, rising to her lips, and calmly
inquired to whom the picture had been sold.

M'Crea answered that for his part he had little dealings in gold and
silver, but every thing of that kind which fell to his share he
transacted with Mr. D----. This person was one of the most eminent of
his profession. His character and place of abode were universally
known. Tho only expedient that remained was to apply to him, and to
ascertain, forthwith, the destiny of the picture. It was too probable
that, when separated from its case, the portrait was thrown away or
destroyed, as a mere encumbrance, but the truth was too momentous to be
made the sport of mere probability. She left the house of M'Crea, and
hastened to that of the goldsmith.

The circumstance was easily recalled to his remembrance. It was true
that such a picture had been offered for sale, and that he had purchased
it. The workmanship was curious, and he felt unwilling to destroy it. He
therefore hung it up in his shop and indulged the hope that a purchaser
would some time be attracted by the mere beauty of the toy.

Constantia's hopes were revived by these tidings, and she earnestly
inquired if it were still in his possession.

"No. A young gentleman had entered his shop some months before: the
picture had caught his fancy, and he had given a price which the artist
owned he should not have demanded, had he not been encouraged by the
eagerness which the gentleman betrayed to possess it."

"Who was this gentleman? Had there been any previous acquaintance
between them? What was his name, his profession, and where was he to be
found?"

"Really," the goldsmith answered, "he was ignorant respecting all those
particulars. Previously to this purchase, the gentleman had sometimes
visited his shop; but he did not recollect to have since seen him. He
was unacquainted with his name and his residence."

"What appeared to be his motives for purchasing this picture?"

"The customer appeared highly pleased with it. Pleasure, rather than
surprise, seemed to be produced by the sight of it. If I were permitted
to judge," continued the artist, "I should imagine that the young man
was acquainted with the original. To say the truth, I hinted as much at
the time, and I did not see that he discouraged the supposition. Indeed,
I cannot conceive how the picture could otherwise have gained any value
in his eyes."

This only heightened the eagerness of Constantia to trace the footsteps
of the youth. It was obvious to suppose some communication or connection
between her friend and this purchaser. She repeated her inquiries, and
the goldsmith, after some consideration, said, "Why, on second thoughts,
I seem to have some notion of having seen a figure like that of my
customer go into a lodging-house in Front Street, some time before I met
with him at my shop."

The situation of this house being satisfactorily described, and the
artist being able to afford her no further information, except as to
stature and guise, she took her leave. There were two motives impelling
her to prosecute her search after this person,--the desire of regaining
this portrait and of procuring tidings of her friend. Involved as she
was in ignorance, it was impossible to conjecture how far this incident
would be subservient to these inestimable purposes. To procure an
interview with this stranger was the first measure which prudence
suggested.

She knew not his name or his person. He was once seen entering a
lodging-house. Thither she must immediately repair; but how to introduce
herself, how to describe the person of whom she was in search, she knew
not. She was beset with embarrassments and difficulties. While her
attention was entangled by these, she proceeded unconsciously on her
way, and stopped not until she reached the mansion that had been
described. Here she paused to collect her thoughts.

She found no relief in deliberation. Every moment added to her
perplexity and indecision. Irresistibly impelled by her wishes, she at
length, in a mood that partook of desperate, advanced to the door and
knocked. The summons was immediately obeyed by a woman of decent
appearance. A pause ensued, which Constantia at length terminated by a
request to see the mistress of the house.

The lady courteously answered that she was the person, and immediately
ushered her visitant into an apartment. Constantia being seated, the
lady waited for the disclosure of her message. To prolong the silence
was only to multiply embarrassments. She reverted to the state of her
feelings, and saw that they flowed from inconsistency and folly. One
vigorous effort was sufficient to restore her to composure and
self-command.

She began with apologizing for a visit unpreceded by an introduction.
The object of her inquiries was a person with whom it was of the utmost
moment that she should procure a meeting, but whom, by an unfortunate
concurrence of circumstances, she was unable to describe by the usual
incidents of name and profession. Her knowledge was confined to his
external appearance, and to the probability of his being an inmate of
this house at the beginning of the year. She then proceeded to describe
his person and dress.

"It is true," said the lady; "such a one as you describe has boarded in
this house. His name was Martynne. I have good reason to remember him,
for he lived with me three months, and then left the country without
paying for his board."

"He has gone, then?" said Constantia, greatly discouraged by these
tidings.

"Yes. He was a man of specious manners and loud pretensions. He came
from England, bringing with him forged recommendatory letters, and,
after passing from one end of the country to the other, contracting
debts which he never paid and making bargains which he never fulfilled,
he suddenly disappeared. It is likely that he has returned to Europe."

"Had he no kindred, no friends, no companions?"

"He found none here. He made pretences to alliances in England, which
better information has, I believe, since shown to be false."

This was the sum of the information procurable from this source.
Constantia was unable to conceal her chagrin. These symptoms were
observed by the lady, whose curiosity was awakened in turn. Questions
were obliquely started, inviting Constantia to a disclosure of her
thoughts. No advantage would arise from confidence, and the guest, after
a few minutes of abstraction and silence, rose to take her leave.

During this conference, some one appeared to be negligently sporting
with the keys of a harpsichord, in the next apartment. The notes were
too irregular and faint to make a forcible impression on the ear. In the
present state of her mind, Constantia was merely conscious of the sound,
in the intervals of conversation. Having arisen from her seat, her
anxiety to obtain some information that might lead to the point she
wished made her again pause. She endeavoured to invent some new
interrogatory better suited to her purpose than those which had already
been employed. A silence on both sides ensued.

During this interval, the unseen musician suddenly refrained from
rambling, and glided into notes of some refinement and complexity. The
cadence was aerial; but a thunderbolt, falling at her feet, would not
have communicated a more visible shock to the senses of Constantia. A
glance that denoted a tumult of soul bordering on distraction was now
fixed upon the door that led into the room from whence the harmony
proceeded. Instantly the cadence was revived, and some accompanying
voice was heard to warble,--

     "Ah! far beyond this world of woes
     We meet to part,--to part no more."

Joy and grief, in their sudden onset and their violent extremes,
approach so nearly in their influence on human beings as scarce to be
distinguished. Constantia's frame was still enfeebled by her recent
distresses. The torrent of emotion was too abrupt and too vehement. Her
faculties were overwhelmed, and she sunk upon the floor motionless and
without sense, but not till she had faintly articulated,--

"My God! My God! This is a joy unmerited and too great."




CHAPTER IV.


I must be forgiven if I now introduce myself on the stage. Sophia
Westwyn is the friend of Constantia, and the writer of this narrative.
So far as my fate was connected with that of my friend, it is worthy to
be known. That connection has constituted the joy and misery of my
existence, and has prompted me to undertake this task.

I assume no merit from the desire of knowledge and superiority to
temptation. There is little of which I can boast; but that little I
derived, instrumentally, from Constantia. Poor as my attainments are, it
is to her that I am indebted for them all. Life itself was the gift of
her father, but my virtue and felicity are her gifts. That I am neither
indigent nor profligate, flows from her bounty.

I am not unaware of the divine superintendence,--of the claims upon my
gratitude and service which pertain to my God. I know that all physical
and moral agents are merely instrumental to the purpose that he wills;
but, though the great Author of being and felicity must not be
forgotten, it is neither possible nor just to overlook the claims upon
our love with which our fellow-beings are invested.

The supreme love does not absorb, but chastens and enforces, all
subordinate affections. In proportion to the rectitude of my perceptions
and the ardour of my piety, must I clearly discern and fervently love
the excellence discovered in my fellow-beings, and industriously promote
their improvement and felicity.

From my infancy to my seventeenth year, I lived in the house of Mr.
Dudley. On the day of my birth I was deserted by my mother. Her temper
was more akin to that of tigress than woman. Yet that is unjust; for
beasts cherish their offspring. No natures but human are capable of that
depravity which makes insensible to the claims of innocence and
helplessness.

But let me not recall her to memory. Have I not enough of sorrow? Yet to
omit my causes of disquiet, the unprecedented forlornness of my
condition, and the persecutions of an unnatural parent, would be to
leave my character a problem, and the sources of my love of Miss Dudley
unexplored. Yet I must not dwell upon that complication of iniquities,
that savage ferocity and unextinguishable hatred of me, which
characterized my unhappy mother.

I was not safe under the protection of Mr. Dudley, nor happy in the
caresses of his daughter. My mother asserted the privilege of that
relation: she laboured for years to obtain the control of my person and
actions, to snatch me from a peaceful and chaste asylum, and detain me
in her own house, where, indeed, I should not have been in want of
raiment and food; but where--

O my mother! Let me not dishonour thy name! Yet it is not in my power to
enhance thy infamy. Thy crimes, unequalled as they were, were perhaps
expiated by thy penitence. Thy offences are too well known; but perhaps
they who witnessed thy freaks of intoxication, thy defiance of public
shame, the enormity of thy pollutions, the infatuation that made thee
glory in the pursuit of a loathsome and detestable trade, may be
strangers to the remorse and the abstinence which accompanied the close
of thy ignominious life.

For ten years was my peace incessantly molested by the menaces or
machinations of my mother. The longer she meditated my destruction, the
more tenacious of her purpose and indefatigable in her efforts she
became. That my mind was harassed with perpetual alarms was not enough.
The fame and tranquillity of Mr. Dudley and his daughter were hourly
assailed. My mother resigned herself to the impulses of malignity and
rage. Headlong passions, and a vigorous though perverted understanding,
were hers. Hence, her stratagems to undermine the reputation of my
protector, and to bereave him of domestic comfort, were subtle and
profound. Had she not herself been careless of that good which she
endeavoured to wrest from others, her artifices could scarcely have been
frustrated.

In proportion to the hazard which accrued to my protector and friend,
the more ardent their zeal in my defence and their affection for my
person became. They watched over me with ineffable solicitude. At all
hours and in every occupation, I was the companion of Constantia. All my
wants were supplied in the same proportion as hers. The tenderness of
Mr. Dudley seemed equally divided between us. I partook of his
instructions, and the means of every intellectual and personal
gratification were lavished upon me.

The speed of my mother's career in infamy was at length slackened. She
left New York, which had long been the theatre of her vices. Actuated by
a now caprice, she determined to travel through the Southern States.
Early indulgence was the cause of her ruin, but her parents had given
her the embellishments of a fashionable education. She delighted to
assume all parts, and personate the most opposite characters. She now
resolved to carry a new name, and the mask of virtue, into scenes
hitherto unvisited.

She journeyed as far as Charleston. Here she met an inexperienced youth,
lately arrived from England, and in possession of an ample fortune. Her
speciousness and artifices seduced him into a precipitate marriage. Her
true character, however, could not be long concealed by herself, and her
vices had been too conspicuous for her long to escape recognition. Her
husband was infatuated by her blandishments. To abandon her, or to
contemplate her depravity with unconcern, were equally beyond his power.
Romantic in his sentiments, his fortitude was unequal to his
disappointments, and he speedily sunk into the grave. By a similar
refinement in generosity, he bequeathed to her his property.

With this accession of wealth, she returned to her ancient abode. The
mask lately worn seemed preparing to be thrown aside, and her profligate
habits to be resumed with more eagerness than ever; but an unexpected
and total revolution was effected, by the exhortations of a Methodist
divine. Her heart seemed, on a sudden, to be remoulded, her vices and
the abettors of them were abjured, she shut out the intrusions of
society, and prepared to expiate, by the rigours of abstinence and the
bitterness of tears, the offences of her past life.

In this, as in her former career, she was unacquainted with restraint
and moderation. Her remorses gained strength in proportion as she
cherished them. She brooded over the images of her guilt, till the
possibility of forgiveness and remission disappeared. Her treatment of
her daughter and her husband constituted the chief source of her
torment. Her awakened conscience refused her a momentary respite from
its persecutions. Her thoughts became, by rapid degrees, tempestuous and
gloomy, and it was at length evident that her condition was maniacal.

In this state, she was to me an object, no longer of terror, but
compassion. She was surrounded by hirelings, devoid of personal
attachment, and anxious only to convert her misfortunes to their own
advantage. This evil it was my duty to obviate. My presence, for a time,
only enhanced the vehemence of her malady; but at length it was only by
my attendance and soothing that she was diverted from the fellest
purposes. Shocking execrations and outrages, resolutions and efforts to
destroy herself and those around her, were sure to take place in my
absence. The moment I appeared before her, her fury abated, her
gesticulations were becalmed, and her voice exerted only in incoherent
and pathetic lamentations.

These scenes, though so different from those which I had formerly been
condemned to witness, were scarcely less excruciating. The friendship of
Constantia Dudley was my only consolation. She took up her abode with
me, and shared with me every disgustful and perilous office which my
mother's insanity prescribed.

Of this consolation, however, it was my fate to be bereaved. My mother's
state was deplorable, and no remedy hitherto employed was efficacious. A
voyage to England was conceived likely to benefit, by change of
temperature and scenes, and by the opportunity it would afford of trying
the superior skill of English physicians. This scheme, after various
struggles on my part, was adopted. It was detestable to my imagination,
because it severed me from that friend in whose existence mine was
involved, and without whose participation knowledge lost its attractions
and society became a torment.

The prescriptions of my duty could not be disguised or disobeyed, and we
parted. A mutual engagement was formed to record every sentiment and
relate every event that happened in the life of either, and no
opportunity of communicating information was to be omitted. This
engagement was punctually performed on my part. I sought out every
method of conveyance to my friend, and took infinite pains to procure
tidings from her; but all were ineffectual.

My mother's malady declined, but was succeeded by a pulmonary disease,
which threatened her speedy destruction. By the restoration of her
understanding, the purpose of her voyage was obtained, and my impatience
to return, which the inexplicable and ominous silence of my friend daily
increased, prompted me to exert all my powers of persuasion to induce
her to revisit America.

My mother's frenzy was a salutary crisis in her moral history. She
looked back upon her past conduct with unspeakable loathing, but this
retrospect only invigorated her devotion and her virtue; but the thought
of returning to the scene of her unhappiness and infamy could not be
endured. Besides, life, in her eyes, possessed considerable attractions,
and her physicians flattered her with recovery from her present disease,
if she would change the atmosphere of England for that of Languedoc and
Naples.

I followed her with murmurs and reluctance. To desert her in her present
critical state would have been inhuman. My mother's aversions and
attachments, habits and views, were dissonant with my own. Conformity of
sentiments and impressions of maternal tenderness did not exist to bind
us to each other. My attendance was assiduous, but it was the sense of
duty that rendered my attendance a supportable task.

Her decay was eminently gradual. No time seemed to diminish her appetite
for novelty and change. During three years we traversed every part of
France, Switzerland, and Italy. I could not but attend to surrounding
scenes, and mark the progress of the mighty revolution, whose effects,
like agitation in a fluid, gradually spread from Paris, the centre, over
the face of the neighbouring kingdoms; but there passed not a day or an
hour in which the image of Constantia was not recalled, in which the
most pungent regrets were not felt at the inexplicable silence which had
been observed by her, and the most vehement longings indulged to return
to my native country. My exertions to ascertain her condition by
indirect means, by interrogating natives of America with whom I chanced
to meet, were unwearied, but, for a long period, ineffectual.

During this pilgrimage, Rome was thrice visited. My mother's
indisposition was hastening to a crisis, and she formed the resolution
of closing her life at the bottom of Vesuvius. We stopped, for the sake
of a few days' repose, at Rome. On the morning after our arrival, I
accompanied some friends to view the public edifices. Casting my eyes
over the vast and ruinous interior of the Coliseum, my attention was
fixed by the figure of a young man whom, after a moment's pause, I
recollected to have seen in the streets of New York. At a distance from
home, mere community of country is no inconsiderable bond of affection.
The social spirit prompts us to cling even to inanimate objects, when
they remind us of ancient fellowships and juvenile attachments.

A servant was despatched to summon this stranger, who recognised a
countrywoman with a pleasure equal to that which I had received. On
nearer view, this person, whose name was Courtland, did not belie my
favourable prepossessions. Our intercourse was soon established on a
footing of confidence and intimacy.

The destiny of Constantia was always uppermost in my thoughts. This
person's acquaintance was originally sought chiefly in the hope of
obtaining from him some information respecting my friend. On inquiry, I
discovered that he had left his native city seven months after me.
Having tasked his recollection and compared a number of facts, the name
of Dudley at length recurred to him. He had casually heard the history
of Craig's imposture and its consequences. These were now related as
circumstantially as a memory occupied by subsequent incidents enabled
him. The tale had been told to him, in a domestic circle which he was
accustomed to frequent, by the person who purchased Mr. Dudley's lute
and restored it to its previous owner on the conditions formerly
mentioned.

This tale filled me with anguish and doubt. My impatience to search out
this unfortunate girl, and share with her her sorrows or relieve them,
was anew excited by this mournful intelligence. That Constantia Dudley
was reduced to beggary was too abhorrent to my feelings to receive
credit; yet the sale of her father's property, comprising even his
furniture and clothing, seemed to prove that she had fallen even to this
depth. This enabled me in some degree to account for her silence. Her
generous spirit would induce her to conceal misfortunes from her friend
which no communication would alleviate. It was possible that she had
selected some new abode, and that, in consequence, the letters I had
written, and which amounted to volumes, had never reached her hands.

My mother's state would not suffer me to obey the impulse of my heart.
Her frame was verging towards dissolution. Courtland's engagements
allowed him to accompany us to Naples, and here the long series of my
mother's pilgrimages closed in death. Her obsequies were no sooner
performed, than I determined to set out on my long-projected voyage. My
mother's property, which, in consequence of her decease, devolved upon
me, was not inconsiderable. There is scarcely any good so dear to a
rational being as competence. I was not unacquainted with its benefits,
but this acquisition was valuable to mo chiefly as it enabled me to
reunite my fate to that of Constantia.

Courtland was my countryman and friend. He was destitute of fortune, and
had been led to Europe partly by the spirit of adventure, and partly on
a mercantile project. He had made sale of his property on advantageous
terms, in the ports of France, and resolved to consume the produce in
examining this scene of heroic exploits and memorable revolutions. His
slender stock, though frugally and even parsimoniously administered, was
nearly exhausted; and, at the time of our meeting at Rome, he was making
reluctant preparations to return.

Sufficient opportunity was afforded us, in an unrestrained and domestic
intercourse of three months, which succeeded our Roman interview, to
gain a knowledge of each other. There was that conformity of tastes and
views between us which could scarcely fail, at an age and in a situation
like ours, to give birth to tenderness. My resolution to hasten to
America was peculiarly unwelcome to my friend. He had offered to be my
companion, but this offer my regard to his interest obliged me to
decline; but I was willing to compensate him for this denial, as well as
to gratify my own heart, by an immediate marriage.

So long a residence in England and Italy had given birth to friendships
and connections of the dearest kind. I had no view but to spend my life
with Courtland, in the midst of my maternal kindred, who were English. A
voyage to America and reunion with Constantia were previously
indispensable; but I hoped that my friend might be prevailed upon, and
that her disconnected situation would permit her to return with me to
Europe. If this end could not be accomplished, it was my inflexible
purpose to live and die with her. Suitably to this arrangement,
Courtland was to repair to London, and wait patiently till I should be
able to rejoin him there, or to summon him to meet me in America.

A week after my mother's death, I became a wife, and embarked the next
day, at Naples, in a Ragusan ship, destined for New York. The voyage was
tempestuous and tedious. The vessel was necessitated to make a short
stay at Toulon. The state of that city, however, then in possession of
the English and besieged by the revolutionary forces, was adverse to
commercial views. Happily, we resumed our voyage on the day previous to
that on which the place was evacuated by the British. Our seasonable
departure rescued us from witnessing a scene of horrors of which the
history of former wars furnishes us with few examples.

A cold and boisterous navigation awaited us. My palpitations and
inquietudes augmented as we approached the American coast. I shall not
forget the sensations which I experienced on the sight of the Beacon at
Sandy Hook. It was first seen at midnight, in a stormy and beclouded
atmosphere, emerging from the waves, whose fluctuation allowed it, for
some time, to be visible only by fits. This token of approaching land
affected me as much as if I had reached the threshold of my friend's
dwelling.

At length we entered the port, and I viewed, with high-raised but
inexplicable feelings, objects with which I had been from infancy
familiar. The flagstaff erected on the Battery recalled to my
imagination the pleasures of the evening and morning walks which I had
taken on that spot with the lost Constantia. The dream was fondly
cherished, that the figure which I saw loitering along the terrace was
hers.

On disembarking, I gazed at every female passenger, in hope that it was
she whom I sought. An absence of three years had obliterated from my
memory none of the images which attended me on my departure.




CHAPTER V.


After a night of repose rather than of sleep, I began the search after
my friend. I went to the house which the Dudleys formerly inhabited, and
which had been the asylum of my infancy. It was now occupied by
strangers, by whom no account could be given of its former tenants. I
obtained directions to the owner of the house. He was equally unable to
satisfy my curiosity. The purchase had been made at a public sale, and
terms had been settled, not with Dudley, but with the sheriff.

It is needless to say that the history of Craig's imposture and its
consequences were confirmed by every one who resided at that period in
New York. The Dudleys were well remembered, and their disappearance,
immediately after their fall, had been generally noticed; but whither
they had retired was a problem which no one was able to solve.

This evasion was strange. By what motives the Dudleys were induced to
change their ancient abode could be vaguely guessed. My friend's
grandfather was a native of the West Indies. Descendants of the same
stock still resided in Tobago. They might be affluent, and to them it
was possible that Mr. Dudley, in this change of fortune, had betaken
himself for relief. This was a mournful expedient, since it would raise
a barrier between my friend and myself scarcely to be surmounted.

Constantia's mother was stolen by Mr. Dudley from a convent at Amiens.
There were no affinities, therefore, to draw them to France. Her
grandmother was a native of Baltimore, of a family of some note, by name
Ridgeley. This family might still exist, and have either afforded an
asylum to the Dudleys, or, at least, be apprized of their destiny. It
was obvious to conclude that they no longer existed within the precincts
of New York. A journey to Baltimore was the next expedient.

This journey was made in the depth of winter, and by the speediest
conveyance. I made no more than a day's sojourn in Philadelphia. The
epidemic by which that city had been lately ravaged, I had not heard of
till my arrival in America. Its devastations were then painted to my
fancy in the most formidable colours. A few months only had elapsed
since its extinction, and I expected to see numerous marks of misery and
depopulation.

To my no small surprise, however, no vestiges of this calamity were to
be discerned. All houses were open, all streets thronged, and all faces
thoughtless or busy. The arts and the amusements of life seemed as
sedulously cultivated as ever. Little did I then think what had been,
and what at that moment was, the condition of my friend. I stopped for
the sake of respite from fatigue, and did not, therefore, pass much time
in the streets. Perhaps, had I walked seasonably abroad, we might have
encountered each other, and thus have saved ourselves from a thousand
anxieties.

At Baltimore I made myself known, without the formality of introduction,
to the Ridgeleys. They acknowledged their relationship to Mr. Dudley,
but professed absolute ignorance of his fate. Indirect intercourse only
had been maintained, formerly, by Dudley with his mother's kindred. They
had heard of his misfortune a twelvemonth after it happened; but what
measures had been subsequently pursued, their kinsman had not thought
proper to inform them.

The failure of this expedient almost bereft me of hope. Neither my own
imagination nor the Ridgeleys could suggest any new mode by which my
purpose was likely to be accomplished. To leave America without
obtaining the end of my visit could not be thought of without agony; and
yet the continuance of my stay promised me no relief from my
uncertainties.

On this theme I ruminated without ceasing. I recalled every conversation
and incident of former times, and sought in them a clue by which my
present conjectures might be guided. One night, immersed alone in my
chamber, my thoughts were thus employed. My train of meditation was, on
this occasion, new. From the review of particulars from which no
satisfaction had hitherto been gained, I passed to a vague and
comprehensive retrospect.

Mr. Dudley's early life, his profession of a painter, his zeal in this
pursuit, and his reluctance to quit it, were remembered. Would he not
revert to this profession when other means of subsistence were gone? It
is true, similar obstacles with those which had formerly occasioned his
resort to a different path existed at present, and no painter of his
name was to be found in Philadelphia, Baltimore, or New York. But would
it not occur to him, that the patronage denied to his skill by the
frugal and unpolished habits of his countrymen might, with more
probability of success, be sought from the opulence and luxury of
London? Nay, had he not once affirmed, in my hearing, that, if he ever
were reduced to poverty, this was the method he would pursue?

This conjecture was too bewitching to be easily dismissed. Every new
reflection augmented its force. I was suddenly raised by it from the
deepest melancholy to the region of lofty and gay hopes. Happiness, of
which I had begun to imagine myself irretrievably bereft, seemed once
more to approach within my reach. Constantia would not only be found,
but be met in the midst of those comforts which her father's skill could
not fail to procure, and on that very stage where I most desired to
encounter her. Mr. Dudley had many friends and associates of his youth
in London. Filial duty had repelled their importunities to fix his abode
in Europe, when summoned home by his father. On his father's death these
solicitations had been renewed, but were disregarded for reasons which
he, afterwards, himself confessed were fallacious. That they would a
third time be preferred, and would regulate his conduct, seemed to me
incontestable.

I regarded with wonder and deep regret the infatuation that had
hitherto excluded these images from my understanding and my memory. How
many dangers and toils had I endured since my embarkation at Naples, to
the present moment! How many lingering minutes had I told since my first
interview with Courtland! All were owing to my own stupidity. Had my
present thoughts been seasonably suggested, I might long since have been
restored to the embraces of my friend, without the necessity of an
hour's separation from my husband.

These were evils to be repaired as far as it was possible. Nothing now
remained but to procure a passage to Europe. For this end diligent
inquiries were immediately set on foot. A vessel was found, which, in a
few weeks, would set out upon the voyage. Having bespoken a conveyance,
it was incumbent on me to sustain with patience the unwelcome delay.

Meanwhile, my mind, delivered from the dejection and perplexities that
lately haunted it, was capable of some attention to surrounding objects.
I marked the peculiarities of manners and language in my new abode, and
studied the effects which a political and religious system so opposite
to that with which I had conversed in Italy and Switzerland had
produced. I found that the difference between Europe and America lay
chiefly in this:--that, in the former, all things tended to extremes,
whereas, in the latter, all things tended to the same level. Genius, and
virtue, and happiness, on these shores, were distinguished by a sort of
mediocrity. Conditions were less unequal, and men were strangers to the
heights of enjoyment and the depths of misery to which the inhabitants
of Europe are accustomed.

I received friendly notice and hospitable treatment from the Ridgeleys.
These people were mercantile and plodding in their habits. I found in
their social circle little exercise for the sympathies of my heart, and
willingly accepted their aid to enlarge the sphere of my observation.

About a week before my intended embarkation, and when suitable
preparation had been made for that event, a lady arrived in town, who
was cousin to my Constantia. She had frequently been mentioned in
favourable terms in my hearing. She had passed her life in a rural
abode with her father, who cultivated his own domain, lying forty miles
from Baltimore.

On an offer being made to introduce us to each other, I consented to
know one whose chief recommendation in my eyes consisted in her affinity
to Constantia Dudley. I found an artless and attractive female,
unpolished and undepraved by much intercourse with mankind. At first
sight, I was powerfully struck by the resemblance of her features to
those of my friend, which sufficiently denoted their connection with a
common stock.

The first interview afforded mutual satisfaction. On our second meeting,
discourse insensibly led to the mention of Miss Dudley, and of the
design which had brought me to America. She was deeply affected by the
earnestness with which I expatiated on her cousin's merits, and by the
proofs which my conduct had given of unlimited attachment.

I dwelt immediately on the measures which I had hitherto ineffectually
pursued to trace her footsteps, and detailed the grounds of my present
belief that we should meet in London. During this recital, my companion
sighed and wept. When I finished my tale, her tears, instead of ceasing,
flowed with new vehemence. This appearance excited some surprise, and I
ventured to ask the cause of her grief.

"Alas!" she replied, "I am personally a stranger to my cousin, but her
character has been amply displayed to me by one who knew her well. I
weep to think how much she has suffered. How much excellence we have
lost!"

"Nay," said I, "all her sufferings will, I hope, be compensated, and I
by no means consider her as lost. If my search in London be
unsuccessful, then shall I indeed despair."

"Despair, then, already," said my sobbing companion, "for your search
will be unsuccessful. How I feel for your disappointment! but it cannot
be known too soon. My cousin is dead!"

These tidings were communicated with tokens of sincerity and sorrow that
left me no room to doubt that they were believed by the relater. My own
emotions were suspended till interrogations had obtained a knowledge of
her reasons for crediting this fatal event, and till she had explained
the time and manner of her death. A friend of Miss Ridgeley's father had
witnessed the devastations of the yellow fever in Philadelphia. He was
apprized of the relationship that subsisted between his friend and the
Dudleys. He gave a minute and circumstantial account of the arts of
Craig. He mentioned the removal of my friends to Philadelphia, their
obscure and indigent life, and, finally, their falling victims to the
pestilence.

He related the means by which he became apprized of their fate, and drew
a picture of their death, surpassing all that imagination can conceive
of shocking and deplorable. The quarter where they lived was nearly
desolate. Their house was shut up, and, for a time, imagined to be
uninhabited. Some suspicions being awakened in those who superintended
the burial of the dead, the house was entered, and the father and child
discovered to be dead. The former was stretched upon his wretched
pallet, while the daughter was found on the floor of the lower room, in
a state that denoted the sufferance not only of disease, but of famine.

This tale was false. Subsequent discoveries proved this to be a
detestable artifice of Craig, who, stimulated by incurable habits, had
invented these disasters, for the purpose of enhancing the opinion of
his humanity and of furthering his views on the fortune and daughter of
Mr. Ridgeley.

Its falsehood, however, I had as yet no means of ascertaining. I
received it as true, and at once dismissed all my claims upon futurity.
All hope of happiness, in this mutable and sublunary scene, was fled.
Nothing remained but to join my friend in a world where woes are at an
end and virtue finds recompense. "Surely," said I, "there will some time
be a close to calamity and discord. To those whose lives have been
blameless, but harassed by inquietudes to which not their own but the
errors of others have given birth, a fortress will hereafter be
assigned unassailable by change, impregnable to sorrow.

"O my ill-fated Constantia! I will live to cherish thy remembrance, and
to emulate thy virtue. I will endure the privation of thy friendship and
the vicissitudes that shall befall me, and draw my consolation and
courage from the foresight of no distant close to this terrestrial
scene, and of ultimate and everlasting union with thee."

This consideration, though it kept me from confusion and despair, could
not, but with the healing aid of time, render me tranquil or strenuous.
My strength was unequal to the struggle of my passions. The ship in
which I engaged to embark could not wait for my restoration to health,
and I was left behind.

Mary Ridgeley was artless and affectionate. She saw that her society was
dearer to me than that of any other, and was therefore seldom willing to
leave my chamber. Her presence, less on her own account than by reason
of her personal resemblance and her affinity by birth to Constantia, was
a powerful solace.

I had nothing to detain me longer in America. I was anxious to change my
present lonely state, for the communion of those friends in England, and
the performance of those duties, which were left to me. I was informed
that a British packet would shortly sail from New York. My frame was
sunk into greater weakness than I had felt at any former period; and I
conceived that to return to New York by water was more commodious than
to perform the journey by land.

This arrangement was likewise destined to be disappointed. One morning I
visited, according to my custom, Mary Ridgeley. I found her in a temper
somewhat inclined to gayety. She rallied me, with great archness, on the
care with which I had concealed from her a tender engagement into which
I had lately entered.

I supposed myself to comprehend her allusion, and therefore answered
that accident, rather than design, had made me silent on the subject of
marriage. She had hitherto known me by no appellation but Sophia
Courtland. I had thought it needless to inform her that I was indebted
for my name to my husband, Courtland being his name.

"All that," said my friend, "I know already. And so you sagely think
that my knowledge goes no further than that? We are not bound to love
our husbands longer than their lives. There is no crime, I believe, in
referring the living to the dead; and most heartily do congratulate you
on your present choice."

"What mean you? I confess, your discourse surpasses my comprehension."

At that moment the bell at the door rung a loud peal. Miss Ridgeley
hastened down at this signal, saying, with much significance,--

"I am a poor hand at solving a riddle. Here comes one who, if I mistake
not, will find no difficulty in clearing up your doubts."

Presently she came up, and said, with a smile of still greater archness,
"Here is a young gentleman, a friend of mine, to whom I must have the
pleasure of introducing you. He has come for the special purpose of
solving my riddle." I attended her to the parlour without hesitation.

She presented me, with great formality, to a youth, whose appearance did
not greatly prepossess me in favour of his judgement. He approached me
with an air supercilious and ceremonious; but the moment he caught a
glance at my face, he shrunk back, visibly confounded and embarrassed. A
pause ensued, in which Miss Ridgeley had opportunity to detect the error
into which she had been led by the vanity of this young man.

"How now, Mr. Martynne!" said my friend, in a tone of ridicule; "is it
possible you do not know the lady who is the queen of your affections,
the tender and indulgent fair one whose portrait you carry in your
bosom, and whose image you daily and nightly bedew with your tears and
kisses?"

Mr. Martynne's confusion, instead of being subdued by his struggle, only
grew more conspicuous; and, after a few incoherent speeches and
apologies, during which he carefully avoided encountering my eyes, he
hastily departed.

I applied to my friend, with great earnestness, for an explanation of
this scene. It seems that, in the course of conversation with him on the
preceding day, he had suffered a portrait which hung at his breast to
catch Miss Ridgeley's eye. On her betraying a desire to inspect it more
nearly, he readily produced it. My image had been too well copied by the
artist not to be instantly recognised.

She concealed her knowledge of the original, and, by questions well
adapted to the purpose, easily drew from him confessions that this was
the portrait of his mistress. He let fall sundry innuendoes and
surmises, tending to impress her with a notion of the rank, fortune, and
intellectual accomplishments of the nymph, and particularly of the
doting fondness and measureless confidence with which she regarded him.

Her imperfect knowledge of my situation left her in some doubt as to the
truth of these pretensions, and she was willing to ascertain the truth
by bringing about an interview. To guard against evasions and artifice
in the lover, she carefully concealed from him her knowledge of the
original, and merely pretended that a friend of hers was far more
beautiful than her whom this picture represented. She added, that she
expected a visit from her friend the next morning, and was willing, by
showing her to Mr. Martynne, to convince him how much he was mistaken in
supposing the perfections of his mistress unrivalled.




CHAPTER VI.


Martynne, while ho expressed his confidence that the experiment would
only confirm his triumph, readily assented to the proposal, and the
interview above described took place, accordingly, the next morning. Had
he not been taken by surprise, it is likely the address of a man who
possessed no contemptible powers would have extricated him from some of
his embarrassment.

That my portrait should be in the possession of one whom I had never
before seen, and whose character and manners entitled him to no respect,
was a source of some surprise. This mode of multiplying faces is
extremely prevalent in this age, and was eminently characteristic of
those with whom I had associated in different parts of Europe. The
nature of my thoughts had modified my features into an expression which
my friends were pleased to consider as a model for those who desired to
personify the genius of suffering and resignation.

Hence, among those whose religion permitted their devotion to a picture
of a female, the symbols of their chosen deity were added to features
and shape that resembled mine. My own caprice, as well as that of
others, always dictated a symbolical, and, in every new instance, a
different accompaniment of this kind. Hence was offered the means of
tracing the history of that picture which Martynne possessed.

It had been accurately examined by Miss Ridgeley, and her description of
the frame in which it was placed instantly informed me that it was the
same which, at our parting, I left in the possession of Constantia. My
friend and myself were desirous of employing the skill of a Saxon
painter, by name Eckstein. Each of us were drawn by him, she with the
cincture of Venus, and I with the crescent of Dian. This symbol was
still conspicuous on the brow of that image which Miss Ridgeley had
examined, and served to identify the original proprietor.

This circumstance tended to confirm my fears that Constantia was dead,
since that she would part with this picture during her life was not to
be believed. It was of little moment to discover how it came into the
hands of the present possessor. Those who carried her remains to the
grave had probably torn it from her neck and afterwards disposed of it
for money.

By whatever means, honest or illicit, it had been acquired by Martynne,
it was proper that it should be restored to me. It was valuable to me,
because it had been the property of one whom I loved, and it might prove
highly injurious to my fame and my happiness, as the tool of this man's
vanity and the attestor of his falsehood. I therefore wrote him a
letter, acquainting him with my reasons for desiring the repossession of
this picture, and offering a price for it at least double its value as a
mere article of traffic. Martynne accepted the terms. He transmitted the
picture, and with it a note, apologizing for the artifice of which he
had been guilty, and mentioning, in order to justify his acceptance of
the price which I had offered, that he had lately purchased it for an
equal sum, of a goldsmith in Philadelphia.

This information suggested a new reflection. Constantia had engaged to
preserve, for the use of her friend, copious and accurate memorials of
her life. Copies of these were, on suitable occasions, to be transmitted
to me during my residence abroad. These I had never received, but it was
highly probable that her punctuality, in the performance of the first
part of her engagement, had been equal to my own.

What, I asked, had become of these precious memorials? In the wreck of
her property were these irretrievably engulfed? It was not probable that
they had been wantonly destroyed. They had fallen, perhaps, into hands
careless or unconscious of their value, or still lay, unknown and
neglected, at the bottom of some closet or chest. Their recovery might
be effected by vehement exertions, or by some miraculous accident.
Suitable inquiries, carried on among those who were active in those
scenes of calamity, might afford some clue by which the fate of the
Dudleys, and the disposition of their property, might come into fuller
light. These inquiries could be made only in Philadelphia, and thither,
for that purpose, I now resolved to repair. There was still an interval
of some weeks before the departure of the packet in which I proposed to
embark.

Having returned to the capital, I devoted all my zeal to my darling
project. My efforts, however, were without success. Those who
administered charity and succour during that memorable season, and who
survived, could remove none of my doubts, nor answer any of my
inquiries. Innumerable tales, equally disastrous with those which Miss
Ridgeley had heard, were related; but, for a considerable period, none
of their circumstances were sufficiently accordant with the history of
the Dudleys.

It is worthy of remark, in how many ways, and by what complexity of
motives, human curiosity is awakened and knowledge obtained. By its
connection with my darling purpose, every event in the history of this
memorable pest was earnestly sought and deeply pondered. The powerful
considerations which governed me made me slight those punctilious
impediments which, in other circumstances, would have debarred me from
intercourse with the immediate actors and observers. I found none who
were unwilling to expatiate on this topic, or to communicate the
knowledge they possessed. Their details were copious in particulars and
vivid in minuteness. They exhibited the state of manners, the
diversified effects of evil or heroic passions, and the endless forms
which sickness and poverty assume in the obscure recesses of a
commercial and populous city.

Some of these details are too precious to be lost. It is above all
things necessary that we should be thoroughly acquainted with the
condition of our fellow-beings. Justice and compassion are the fruit of
knowledge. The misery that overspreads so large a part of mankind exists
chiefly because those who are able to relieve it do not know that it
exists. Forcibly to paint the evil, seldom fails to excite the virtue of
the spectator and seduce him into wishes, at least, if not into
exertions, of beneficence.

The circumstances in which I was placed were, perhaps, wholly singular.
Hence, the knowledge I obtained was more comprehensive and authentic
than was possessed by any one, even of the immediate actors or
sufferers. This knowledge will not be useless to myself or to the world.
The motives which dictated the present narrative will hinder me from
relinquishing the pen till my fund of observation and experience be
exhausted. Meanwhile, let me resume the thread of my tale.

The period allowed me before my departure was nearly expired, and my
purpose seemed to be as far from its accomplishment as ever. One evening
I visited a lady who was the widow of a physician whose disinterested
exertions had cost him his life. She dwelt with pathetic earnestness on
the particulars of her own distress, and listened with deep attention to
the inquiries and doubts which I had laid before her.

After a pause of consideration, she said that an incident like that
related by me she had previously heard from one of her friends, whose
name she mentioned. This person was one of those whose office consisted
in searching out the sufferers, and affording them unsought and
unsolicited relief. She was offering to introduce me to this person,
when he entered the apartment.

After the usual compliments, my friend led the conversation as I wished.
Between Mr. Thompson's tale and that related to Miss Ridgeley there was
an obvious resemblance. The sufferers resided in an obscure alley. They
had shut themselves up from all intercourse with their neighbours, and
had died, neglected and unknown. Mr. Thompson was vested with the
superintendence of this district, and had passed the house frequently
without suspicion of its being tenanted.

He was at length informed, by one of those who conducted a hearse, that
he had seen the window in the upper story of this house lifted and a
female show herself. It was night, and the hearseman chanced to be
passing the door. He immediately supposed that the person stood in need
of his services, and stopped.

This procedure was comprehended by the person at the window, who,
leaning out, addressed him in a broken and feeble voice. She asked him
why he had not taken a different route, and upbraided him for inhumanity
in leading his noisy vehicle past her door. She wanted repose, but the
ceaseless rumbling of his wheels would not allow her the sweet respite
of a moment.

This invective was singular, and uttered in a voice which united the
utmost degree of earnestness with a feebleness that rendered it almost
inarticulate. The man was at a loss for a suitable answer. His pause
only increased the impatience of the person at the window, who called
upon him, in a still more anxious tone, to proceed, and entreated him to
avoid this alley for the future.

He answered that he must come whenever the occasion called him; that
three persons now lay dead in this alley, and that he must be
expeditious in their removal; but that he would return as seldom and
make as little noise as possible.

He was interrupted by new exclamations and upbraidings. These terminated
in a burst of tears, and assertions that God and man were her
enemies,--that they were determined to destroy her; but she trusted that
the time would come when their own experience would avenge her wrongs,
and teach them some compassion for the misery of others. Saying this,
she shut the window with violence, and retired from it, sobbing with a
vehemence that could be distinctly overheard by him in the street.

He paused for some time, listening when this passion should cease. The
habitation was slight, and he imagined that he heard her traversing the
floor. While he stayed, she continued to vent her anguish in
exclamations and sighs and passionate weeping. It did not appear that
any other person was within.

Mr. Thompson, being next day informed of these incidents, endeavoured to
enter the house; but his signals, though loud and frequently repeated,
being unnoticed, he was obliged to gain admission by violence. An old
man, and a female lovely in the midst of emaciation and decay, were
discovered without signs of life. The death of the latter appeared to
have been very recent.

In examining the house, no traces of other inhabitants were to be found.
Nothing serviceable as food was discovered, but the remnants of mouldy
bread scattered on a table. No information could be gathered from
neighbours respecting the condition and name of these unfortunate
people. They had taken possession of this house during the rage of this
malady, and refrained from all communication with their neighbours.

There was too much resemblance between this and the story formerly
heard, not to produce the belief that they related to the same persons.
All that remained was to obtain directions to the proprietor of this
dwelling, and exact from him all that he knew respecting his tenants.

I found in him a man of worth and affability. He readily related, that a
man applied to him for the use of this house, and that the application
was received. At the beginning of the pestilence, a numerous family
inhabited this tenement, but had died in rapid succession. This new
applicant was the first to apprize him of this circumstance, and
appeared extremely anxious to enter on immediate possession.

It was intimated to him that danger would arise from the pestilential
condition of the house. Unless cleansed and purified, disease would be
unavoidably contracted. The inconvenience and hazard this applicant was
willing to encounter, and, at length, hinted that no alternative was
allowed him by his present landlord but to lie in the street or to
procure some other abode.

"What was the external appearance of this person?"

"He was infirm, past the middle age, of melancholy aspect and indigent
garb. A year had since elapsed, and more characteristic particulars had
not been remarked, or were forgotten. The name had been mentioned, but,
in the midst of more recent and momentous transactions, had vanished
from remembrance. Dudley, or Dolby, or Hadley, seemed to approach more
nearly than any other sounds."

Permission to inspect the house was readily granted. It had remained,
since that period, unoccupied. The furniture and goods were scanty and
wretched, and he did not care to endanger his safety by meddling with
them. He believed that they had not been removed or touched.

I was insensible of any hazard which attended my visit, and, with the
guidance of a servant, who felt as little apprehension as myself,
hastened to the spot. I found nothing but tables and chairs. Clothing
was nowhere to be seen. An earthen pot, without handle, and broken,
stood upon the kitchen-hearth. No other implement or vessel for the
preparation of food appeared.

These forlorn appearances were accounted for by the servant, by
supposing the house to have been long since rifled of every thing worth
the trouble of removal, by the villains who occupied the neighbouring
houses,--this alley, it seems, being noted for the profligacy of its
inhabitants.

When I reflected that a wretched hovel like this had been, probably, the
last retreat of the Dudleys, when I painted their sufferings, of which
the numberless tales of distress of which I had lately been an auditor
enabled me to form an adequate conception, I felt as if to lie down and
expire on the very spot where Constantia had fallen was the only
sacrifice to friendship which time had left to me.

From this house I wandered to the field where the dead had been,
promiscuously and by hundreds, interred. I counted the long series of
graves, which were closely ranged, and, being recently levelled,
exhibited the appearance of a harrowed field. Methought I could have
given thousands to know in what spot the body of my friend lay, that I
might moisten the sacred earth with my tears. Boards hastily nailed
together formed the best receptacle which the exigencies of the time
could grant to the dead. Many corpses were thrown into a single
excavation, and all distinctions founded on merit and rank were
obliterated. The father and child had been placed in the same cart and
thrown into the same hole.

Despairing, by any longer stay in the city, to effect my purpose, and
the period of my embarkation being near, I prepared to resume my
journey. I should have set out the next day, but, a family with whom I
had made acquaintance expecting to proceed to New York within a week, I
consented to be their companion, and, for that end, to delay my
departure.

Meanwhile, I shut myself up in my apartment, and pursued avocations that
were adapted to the melancholy tenor of my thoughts. The day preceding
that appointed for my journey arrived. It was necessary to complete my
arrangements with the family with whom I was to travel, and to settle
with the lady whose apartments I occupied.

On how slender threads does our destiny hang! Had not a momentary
impulse tempted me to sing my favourite ditty to the harpsichord, to
beguile the short interval during which my hostess was conversing with
her visitor in the next apartment, I should have speeded to New York,
have embarked for Europe, and been eternally severed from my friend,
whom I believed to have died in frenzy and beggary, but who was alive
and affluent, and who sought me with a diligence scarcely inferior to my
own. We imagined ourselves severed from each other by death or by
impassable seas; but, at the moment when our hopes had sunk to the
lowest ebb, a mysterious destiny conducted our footsteps to the same
spot.

I heard a murmuring exclamation; I heard my hostess call, in a voice of
terror, for help; I rushed into the room; I saw one stretched on the
floor, in the attitude of death; I sprung forward and fixed my eyes upon
her countenance; I clasped my hands and articulated, "Constantia!"

She speedily recovered from her swoon. Her eyes opened; she moved, she
spoke. Still methought it was an illusion of the senses that created the
phantom. I could not bear to withdraw my eyes from her countenance. If
they wandered for a moment, I fell into doubt and perplexity, and again
fixed them upon her, to assure myself of her existence.

The succeeding three days were spent in a state of dizziness and
intoxication. The ordinary functions of nature were disturbed. The
appetite for sleep and for food were confounded and lost amidst the
impetuosities of a master-passion. To look and to talk to each other
afforded enchanting occupation for every moment. I would not part from
her side, but eat and slept, walked and mused and read, with my arm
locked in hers, and with her breath fanning my cheek.

I have indeed much to learn. Sophia Courtland has never been wise. Her
affections disdain the cold dictates of discretion, and spurn at every
limit that contending duties and mixed obligations prescribe.

And yet, O precious inebriation of the heart! O pre-eminent love! what
pleasure of reason or of sense can stand in competition with those
attendant upon thee? Whether thou hiest to the fanes of a benevolent
deity, or layest all thy homage at the feet of one who most visibly
resembles the perfections of our Maker, surely thy sanction is divine,
thy boon is happiness!




CHAPTER VII.


The tumults of curiosity and pleasure did not speedily subside. The
story of each other's wanderings was told with endless amplification and
minuteness. Henceforth, the stream of our existence was to mix; we were
to act and to think in common; casual witnesses and written testimony
should become superfluous. Eyes and ears were to be eternally employed
upon the conduct of each other; death, when it should come, was not to
be deplored, because it was an unavoidable and brief privation to her
that should survive. Being, under any modification, is dear; but that
state to which death is a passage is all-desirable to virtue and
all-compensating to grief.

Meanwhile, precedent events were made the themes of endless
conversation. Every incident and passion in the course of four years was
revived and exhibited. The name of Ormond was, of course, frequently
repeated by my friend. His features and deportment were described; her
meditations and resolutions, with regard to him, fully disclosed. My
counsel was asked, in what manner it became her to act.

I could not but harbour aversion to a scheme which should tend to sever
me from Constantia, or to give me a competitor in her affections.
Besides this, the properties of Ormond were of too mysterious a nature
to make him worthy of acceptance. Little more was known concerning him
than what he himself had disclosed to the Dudleys, but this knowledge
would suffice to invalidate his claims.

He had dwelt, in his conversations with Constantia, sparingly on his own
concerns. Yet he did not hide from her that he had been left in early
youth to his own guidance; that he had embraced, when almost a child,
the trade of arms; that he had found service and promotion in the armies
of Potemkin and Romanzow; that he had executed secret and diplomatic
functions at Constantinople and Berlin; that in the latter city he had
met with schemers and reasoners who aimed at the new-modelling of the
world, and the subversion of all that has hitherto been conceived
elementary and fundamental in the constitution of man and of government;
that some of those reformers had secretly united to break down the
military and monarchical fabric of German policy; that others, more
wisely, had devoted their secret efforts, not to overturn, but to build;
that, for this end, they embraced an exploring and colonizing project;
that he had allied himself to these, and for the promotion of their
projects had spent six years of his life in journeys by sea and land, in
tracts unfrequented till then by any European.

What were the moral or political maxims which this adventurous and
visionary sect had adopted, and what was the seat of their new-born
empire,--whether on the shore of an _austral_ continent, or in the heart
of desert America,--he carefully concealed. These were exhibited or
hidden, or shifted, according to his purpose. Not to reveal too much,
and not to tire curiosity or overtask belief, was his daily labour. He
talked of alliance with the family whose name he bore, and who had lost
their honours and estates by the Hanoverian succession to the crown of
England.

I had seen too much of innovation and imposture, in, France and Italy,
not to regard a man like this with aversion and fear. The mind of my
friend was wavering and unsuspicious. She had lived at a distance from
scenes where principles are hourly put to the test of experiment; where
all extremes of fortitude and pusillanimity are accustomed to meet;
where recluse virtue and speculative heroism gives place, as if by
magic, to the last excesses of debauchery and wickedness; where pillage
and murder are engrafted on systems of all-embracing and self-oblivious
benevolence, and the good of mankind is professed to be pursued with
bonds of association and covenants of secrecy. Hence, my friend had
decided without the sanction of experience, had allowed herself to
wander into untried paths, and had hearkened to positions pregnant with
destruction and ignominy.

It was not difficult to exhibit in their true light the enormous errors
of this man, and the danger of prolonging their intercourse. Her assent
to accompany me to England was readily obtained. Too much despatch could
not be used; but the disposal of her property must first take place.
This was necessarily productive of some delay.

I had been made, contrary to inclination, expert in the management of
all affairs relative to property. My mother's lunacy, subsequent
disease, and death, had imposed upon me obligations and cares little
suitable to my sex and age. They could not be eluded or transferred to
others; and, by degrees, experience enlarged my knowledge and
familiarized my tasks.

It was agreed that I should visit and inspect my friend's estate in
Jersey, while she remained in her present abode, to put an end to the
views and expectations of Ormond, and to make preparation for her
voyage. We were reconciled to a temporary separation by the necessity
that prescribed it.

During our residence together, the mind of Constantia was kept in
perpetual ferment. The second day after my departure, the turbulence of
her feelings began to subside, and she found herself at leisure to
pursue those measures which her present situation prescribed.

The time prefixed by Ormond for the termination of his absence had
nearly arrived. Her resolutions respecting this man, lately formed, now
occurred to her. Her heart drooped as she revolved the necessity of
disuniting their fates; but that this disunion was proper could not
admit of doubt. How information of her present views might be most
satisfactorily imparted to him, was a question not instantly decided.
She reflected on the impetuosity of his character, and conceived that
her intentions might be most conveniently unfolded in a letter. This
letter she immediately sat down to write. Just then the door opened, and
Ormond entered the apartment.

She was somewhat, and for a moment, startled by this abrupt and
unlooked-for entrance. Yet she greeted him with pleasure. Her greeting
was received with coldness. A second glance at his countenance informed
her that his mind was somewhat discomposed.

Folding his hands on his breast, ho stalked to the window and looked up
at the moon. Presently he withdrew his gaze from this object, and fixed
it upon Constantia. He spoke, but his words were produced by a kind of
effort.

"Fit emblem," he exclaimed, "of human versatility! One impediment is
gone. I hoped it was the only one. But no! the removal of that merely
made room for another. Let this be removed. Well, fate will interplace a
third. All our toils will thus be frustrated, and the ruin will finally
redound upon our heads." There he stopped.

This strain could not be interpreted by Constantia. She smiled, and,
without noticing his incoherences, proceeded to inquire into his
adventures during their separation. He listened to her, but his eyes,
fixed upon hers, and his solemnity of aspect, were immovable. When she
paused, he seated himself close to her, and, grasping her hand with a
vehemence that almost pained her, said,--

"Look at me; steadfastly. Can you read my thoughts? Can your discernment
reach the bounds of my knowledge and the bottom of my purposes? Catch
you not a view of the monsters that are starting into birth _here_?"
(and he put his left hand to his forehead.) "But you cannot. Should I
paint them to you verbally, you would call me jester or deceiver. What
pity that you have not instruments for piercing into thoughts!"

"I presume," said Constantia, affecting cheerfulness which she did not
feel, "such instruments would be useless to me. You never scruple to say
what you think. Your designs are no sooner conceived than they are
expressed. All you know, all you wish, and all you purpose, are known
to others as soon as to yourself. No scruples of decorum, no foresight
of consequences, are obstacles in your way."

"True," replied he; "all obstacles are trampled under foot but one."

"What is the insuperable one?"

"Incredulity in him that hears. I must not say what will not be
credited. I must not relate feats and avow schemes, when my hearer will
say, 'Those feats were never performed; these schemes are not yours.' I
care not if the truth of my tenets and the practicability of my purposes
be denied. Still, I will openly maintain them; but when my assertions
will themselves be disbelieved, when it is denied that I adopt the creed
and project the plans which I affirm to be adopted and projected by me,
it is needless to affirm.

"To-morrow I mean to ascertain the height of the lunar mountains by
travelling to the top of them. Then I will station myself in the track
of the last comet, and wait till its circumvolution suffers me to leap
upon it; then, by walking on its surface, I will ascertain whether it be
hot enough to burn my soles. Do you believe that this can be done?"

"No."

"Do you believe, in consequence of my assertion, that I design to do
this, and that, in my apprehension, it is easy to be done?"

"Not unless I previously believe you to be lunatic."

"Then why should I assert my purposes? Why speak, when the hearer will
infer nothing from my speech but that I am either lunatic or liar?"

"In that predicament, silence is best."

"In that predicament I now stand. I am not going to unfold myself. Just
now, I pitied thee for want of eyes. 'Twas a foolish compassion. Thou
art happy, because thou seest not an inch before thee or behind." Here
he was for a moment buried in thought; then, breaking from his reverie,
he said, "So your father is dead?"

"True," said Constantia, endeavouring to suppress her rising emotions;
"he is no more. It is so recent an event that I imagined you a stranger
to it."

"False imagination! Thinkest thou I would refrain from knowing what so
nearly concerns us both? Perhaps your opinion of my ignorance extends
beyond this. Perhaps I know not your fruitless search for a picture.
Perhaps I neither followed you nor led you to a being called Sophia
Courtland. I was not present at the meeting. I am unapprized of the
effects of your romantic passion for each other. I did not witness the
rapturous effusions and inexorable counsels of the newcomer. I know not
the contents of the letter which you are preparing to write."

As he spoke this, the accents of Ormond gradually augmented in
vehemence. His countenance bespoke a deepening inquietude and growing
passion. He stopped at the mention of the letter, because his voice was
overpowered by emotion. This pause afforded room for the astonishment of
Constantia. Her interviews and conversations with me took place at
seasons of general repose, when all doors were fast and avenues shut, in
the midst of silence, and in the bosom of retirement. The theme of our
discourse was, commonly, too sacred for any ears but our own;
disclosures were of too intimate and delicate a nature for any but a
female audience; they were too injurious to the fame and peace of Ormond
for him to be admitted to partake of them: yet his words implied a full
acquaintance with recent events, and with purposes and deliberations
shrouded, as we imagined, in impenetrable secrecy.

As soon as Constantia recovered from the confusion of these thoughts,
she eagerly questioned him:--"What do you know? How do you know what has
happened, or what is intended?"

"Poor Constantia!" he exclaimed, in a tone bitter and sarcastic. "How
hopeless is thy ignorance! To enlighten thee is past my power. What
do I know? Every thing. Not a tittle has escaped me. Thy letter is
superfluous; I know its contents before they are written. I was
to be told that a soldier and a traveller, a man who refused his
faith to dreams, and his homage to shadows, merited only scorn and
forgetfulness. That thy affections and person were due to another; that
intercourse between us was henceforth to cease; that preparation was
making for a voyage to Britain, and that Ormond was to walk to his grave
alone!"

In spite of harsh tones and inflexible features, these words were
accompanied with somewhat that betrayed a mind full of discord and
agony. Constantia's astonishment was mingled with dejection. The
discovery of a passion deeper and less curable than she suspected--the
perception of embarrassments and difficulties in the path which she had
chosen, that had not previously occurred to her--threw her mind into
anxious suspense.

The measures she had previously concerted were still approved. To part
from Ormond was enjoined by every dictate of discretion and duty. An
explanation of her motives and views could not take place more
seasonably than at present. Every consideration of justice to herself
and humanity to Ormond made it desirable that this interview should be
the last. By inexplicable means, he had gained a knowledge of her
intentions. It was expedient, therefore, to state them with clearness
and force. In what words this was to be done, was the subject of
momentary deliberation.

Her thoughts were discerned, and her speech anticipated, by her
companion:--"Why droopest thou, and why thus silent, Constantia? The
secret of thy fate will never be detected. Till thy destiny be finished,
it will not be the topic of a single fear. But not for thyself, but me,
art thou concerned. Thou dreadest, yet determinest, to confirm my
predictions of thy voyage to Europe and thy severance from me.

"Dismiss thy inquietudes on that score. What misery thy scorn and thy
rejection are able to inflict is inflicted already. Thy decision was
known to me as soon as it was formed. Thy motives were known. Not an
argument or plea of thy counsellor, not a syllable of her invective, not
a sound of her persuasive rhetoric, escaped my hearing. I know thy
decree to be immutable. As my doubts, so my wishes have taken their
flight. Perhaps, in the depth of thy ignorance, it was supposed that I
should struggle to reverse thy purpose by menaces or supplications; that
I should boast of the cruelty with which I should avenge an imaginary
wrong upon myself. No. All is very well. Go. Not a whisper of objection
or reluctance shalt thou hear from me."

"If I could think," said Constantia, with tremulous hesitation, "that
you part from me without anger; that you see the rectitude of my
proceeding--"

"Anger! Rectitude! I pr'ythee, peace. I know thou art going.--I know
that all objection to thy purpose would be vain. Thinkest thou that thy
stay, undictated by love, the mere fruit of compassion, would afford me
pleasure or crown my wishes? No. I am not so dastardly a wretch. There
was something in thy power to bestow, but thy will accords not with thy
power. I merit not the boon, and thou refusest it. I am content."

Here Ormond fixed more significant eyes upon her. "Poor Constantia!" he
continued. "Shall I warn thee of the danger that awaits thee? For what
end? To elude it is impossible. It will come, and thou, perhaps, wilt be
unhappy. Foresight that enables not to shun, only precreates, the evil.

"Come it will. Though future, it knows not the empire of contingency. An
inexorable and immutable decree enjoins it. Perhaps it is thy nature to
meet with calmness what cannot be shunned. Perhaps, when it is past, thy
reason will perceive its irrevocable nature, and restore thee to peace.
Such is the conduct of the wise; but such, I fear, the education of
Constantia Dudley will debar her from pursuing.

"Fain would I regard it as the test of thy wisdom. I look upon thy past
life. All the forms of genuine adversity have beset thy youth. Poverty,
disease, servile labour, a criminal and hapless parent, have been evils
which thou hast not ungracefully sustained. An absent friend and
murdered father were added to thy list of woes, and here thy courage was
deficient. Thy soul was proof against substantial misery, but sunk into
helpless cowardice at the sight of phantoms.

"One more disaster remains. To call it by its true name would be useless
or pernicious. Useless, because thou wouldst pronounce its occurrence
impossible; pernicious, because, if its possibility were granted, the
omen would distract thee with fear. How shall I describe it? Is it loss
of fame? No. The deed will be unwitnessed by a human creature. Thy
reputation will be spotless, for nothing will be done by thee unsuitable
to the tenor of thy past life. Calumny will not be heard to whisper. All
that know thee will be lavish of their eulogies as ever. Their eulogies
will be as justly merited. Of this merit thou wilt entertain as just and
as adequate conceptions as now.

"It is no repetition of the evils thou hast already endured; it is
neither drudgery, nor sickness, nor privation of friends. Strange
perverseness of human reason! It is an evil; it will be thought upon
with agony; it will close up all the sources of pleasurable
recollection; it will exterminate hope; it will endear oblivion, and
push thee into an untimely grave. Yet to grasp it is impossible. The
moment we inspect it nearly, it vanishes. Thy claims to human
approbation and divine applause will be undiminished and unaltered by
it. The testimony of approving conscience will have lost none of its
explicitness and energy. Yet thou wilt feed upon sighs; thy tears will
flow without remission; thou wilt grow enamoured of death, and perhaps
wilt anticipate the stroke of disease.

"Yet perhaps my prediction is groundless as my knowledge. Perhaps thy
discernment will avail to make thee wise and happy. Perhaps thou wilt
perceive thy privilege of sympathetic and intellectual activity to be
untouched. Heaven grant the non-fulfilment of my prophecy, thy
disenthralment from error, and the perpetuation of thy happiness."

Saying this, Ormond withdrew. His words were always accompanied with
gestures and looks and tones that fastened the attention of the hearer;
but the terms of his present discourse afforded, independently of
gesticulation and utterance, sufficient motives to attention and
remembrance. He was gone, but his image was contemplated by Constantia;
his words still rung in her ears.

The letter she designed to compose was rendered, by this interview,
unnecessary. Meanings of which she and her friend alone were conscious
were discovered by Ormond, through some other medium than words; yet
that was impossible. A being unendowed with preternatural attributes
could gain the information which this man possessed, only by the
exertion of his senses.

All human precautions had been used to baffle the attempts of any secret
witness. She recalled to mind the circumstances in which conversations
with her friend had taken place. All had been retirement, secrecy, and
silence. The hours usually dedicated to sleep had been devoted to this
better purpose. Much had been said, in a voice low and scarcely louder
than a whisper. To have overheard it at the distance of a few feet was
apparently impossible.

Their conversations had not been recorded by her. It could not be
believed that this had been done by Sophia Courtland. Had Ormond and her
friend met during the interval that had elapsed between her separation
from the latter and her meeting with the former? Human events are
conjoined by links imperceptible to keenest eyes. Of Ormond's means of
information she was wholly unapprized. Perhaps accident would some time
unfold them. One thing was incontestable:--that her schemes and her
reasons for adopting them were known to him.

What unforeseen effects had that knowledge produced! In what ambiguous
terms had he couched his prognostics of some mighty evil that awaited
her! He had given a terrible but contradictory description of her
destiny. An event was to happen, akin to no calamity which she had
already endured, disconnected with all which the imagination of man is
accustomed to deprecate, capable of urging her to suicide, and yet of a
kind which left it undecided whether she would regard it with
indifference.

What reliance should she place upon prophetic incoherences thus wild?
What precautions should she take against a danger thus inscrutable and
imminent?




CHAPTER VIII.


These incidents and reflections were speedily transmitted to me. I had
always believed the character and machinations of Ormond to be worthy of
caution and fear. His means of information I did not pretend, and
thought it useless, to investigate. We cannot hide our actions and
thoughts from one of powerful sagacity, whom the detection sufficiently
interests to make him use all the methods of detection in his power. The
study of concealment is, in all cases, fruitless or hurtful. All that
duty enjoins is to design and to execute nothing which may not be
approved by a divine and omniscient Observer. Human scrutiny is neither
to be solicited nor shunned. Human approbation or censure can never be
exempt from injustice, because our limited perceptions debar us from a
thorough knowledge of any actions and motives but our own.

On reviewing what had passed between Constantia and me, I recollected
nothing incompatible with purity and rectitude. That Ormond was apprized
of all that had passed, I by no means inferred from the tenor of his
conversation with Constantia; nor, if this had been incontestably
proved, should I have experienced any trepidation or anxiety on that
account.

His obscure and indirect menaces of evil were of more importance. His
discourse on this topic seemed susceptible only of two constructions.
Either he intended some fatal mischief, and was willing to torment her
by fears, while he concealed from her the nature of her danger, that he
might hinder her from guarding her safety by suitable precautions; or,
being hopeless of rendering her propitious to his wishes, his malice was
satisfied with leaving her a legacy of apprehension and doubt.
Constantia's unacquaintance with the doctrines of that school in which
Ormond was probably instructed led her to regard the conduct of this man
with more curiosity and wonder than fear. She saw nothing but a
disposition to sport with her ignorance and bewilder her with doubts.

I do not believe myself destitute of courage. Rightly to estimate the
danger and encounter it with firmness are worthy of a rational being;
but to place our security in thoughtlessness and blindness is only less
ignoble than cowardice. I could not forget the proofs of violence which
accompanied the death of Mr. Dudley. I could not overlook, in the recent
conversation with Constantia, Ormond's allusion to her murdered father.
It was possible that the nature of this death had been accidentally
imparted to him; but it was likewise possible that his was the knowledge
of one who performed the act.

The enormity of this deed appeared by no means incongruous with the
sentiments of Ormond. Human life is momentous or trivial in our eyes,
according to the course which our habits and opinions have taken.
Passion greedily accepts, and habit readily offers, the sacrifice of
another's life, and reason obeys the impulse of education and desire.

A youth of eighteen, a volunteer in a Russian army encamped in
Bessarabia, made prey of a Tartar girl, found in the field of a recent
battle. Conducting her to his quarters, he met a friend, who, on some
pretence, claimed the victim. From angry words they betook themselves to
swords. A combat ensued, in which the first claimant ran his antagonist
through the body. He then bore his prize unmolested away, and, having
exercised brutality of one kind upon the helpless victim, stabbed her to
the heart, as an offering to the _manes_ of Sarsefield, the friend whom
he had slain. Next morning, willing more signally to expiate his guilt,
he rushed alone upon a troop of Turkish foragers, and brought away five
heads, suspended, by their gory locks, to his horse's mane. These he
cast upon the grave of Sarsefield, and conceived himself fully to have
expiated yesterday's offence. In reward for his prowess, the general
gave him a commission in the Cossack troops. This youth was Ormond; and
such is a specimen of his exploits during a military career of eight
years, in a warfare the most savage and implacable, and, at the same
time, the most iniquitous and wanton, which history records.

With passions and habits like these, the life of another was a trifling
sacrifice to vengeance or impatience. How Mr. Dudley had excited the
resentment of Ormond, by what means the assassin had accomplished his
intention without awakening alarm or incurring suspicion, it was not for
me to discover. The inextricability of human events, the imperviousness
of cunning, and the obduracy of malice, I had frequent occasions to
remark.

I did not labour to vanquish the security of my friend. As to
precautions, they were useless. There was no fortress, guarded by
barriers of stone and iron and watched by sentinels that never slept, to
which she might retire from his stratagems. If there were such a
retreat, it would scarcely avail her against a foe circumspect and
subtle as Ormond.

I pondered on the condition of my friend. I reviewed the incidents of
her life. I compared her lot with that of others. I could not but
discover a sort of incurable malignity in her fate. I felt as if it were
denied to her to enjoy a long life or permanent tranquillity. I asked
myself what she had done, entitling her to this incessant persecution.
Impatience and murmuring took place of sorrow and fear in my heart. When
I reflected that all human agency was merely subservient to a divine
purpose, I fell into fits of accusation and impiety.

This injustice was transient, and soberer views convinced me that every
scheme, comprising the whole, must be productive of partial and
temporary evil. The sufferings of Constantia were limited to a moment;
they were the unavoidable appendages of terrestrial existence; they
formed the only avenue to wisdom, and the only claim to uninterrupted
fruition and eternal repose in an after-scene.

The course of my reflections, and the issue to which they led, were
unforeseen by myself. Fondly as I doted upon this woman, methought I
could resign her to the grave without a murmur or a tear. While my
thoughts were calmed by resignation, and my fancy occupied with nothing
but the briefness of that space and evanescence of that time which
severs the living from the dead, I contemplated, almost with
complacency, a violent or untimely close to her existence.

This loftiness of mind could not always be accomplished or constantly
maintained. One effect of my fears was to hasten my departure to Europe.
There existed no impediment but the want of a suitable conveyance. In
the first packet that should leave America, it was determined to secure
a passage. Mr. Melbourne consented to take charge of Constantia's
property, and, after the sale of it, to transmit to her the money that
should thence arise.

Meanwhile, I was anxious that Constantia should leave her present abode
and join me in New York. She willingly adopted this arrangement, but
conceived it necessary to spend a few days at her house in Jersey. She
could reach the latter place without much deviation from the straight
road, and she was desirous of resurveying a spot where many of her
infantile days had been spent.

This house and domain I have already mentioned to have once belonged to
Mr. Dudley. It was selected with the judgement and adorned with the taste
of a disciple of the schools of Florence and Vicenza. In his view,
cultivation was subservient to the picturesque, and a mansion was
erected, eminent for nothing but chastity of ornaments and simplicity of
structure. The massive parts were of stone; the outer surfaces were
smooth, snow-white, and diversified by apertures and cornices, in which
a cement uncommonly tenacious was wrought into proportions the most
correct and forms the most graceful. The floors, walls, and ceilings,
consisted of a still more exquisitely-tempered substance, and were
painted by Mr. Dudley's own hand. All appendages of this building, as
seats, tables, and cabinets, were modelled by the owner's particular
direction, and in a manner scrupulously classical.

He had scarcely entered on the enjoyment of this splendid possession,
when it was ravished away. No privation was endured with more impatience
than this; but, happily, it was purchased by one who left Mr. Dudley's
arrangements unmolested, and who shortly after conveyed it entire to
Ormond. By him it was finally appropriated to the use of Helena Cleves,
and now, by a singular contexture of events, it had reverted to those
hands in which the death of the original proprietor, if no other change
had been made in his condition, would have left it. The farm still
remained in the tenure of a German emigrant, who held it partly on
condition of preserving the garden and mansion in safety and in perfect
order.

This retreat was now revisited by Constantia, after an interval of four
years. Autumn had made some progress, but the aspect of nature was, so
to speak, more significant than at any other season. She was agreeably
accommodated under the tenant's roof, and found a nameless pleasure in
traversing spaces in which every object prompted an endless train of
recollections.

Her sensations were not foreseen. They led to a state of mind
inconsistent, in some degree, with the projects adopted in obedience to
the suggestions of a friend. Every thing in this scene had been created
and modelled by the genius of her father. It was a kind of fane,
sanctified by his imaginary presence.

To consign the fruits of his industry and invention to foreign and
unsparing hands seemed a kind of sacrilege, for which she almost feared
that the dead would rise to upbraid her. Those images which bind us to
our natal soil, to the abode of our innocent and careless youth, were
recalled to her fancy by the scenes which she now beheld. These were
enforced by considerations of the dangers which attended her voyage from
storms and from enemies, and from the tendency to revolution and war
which seemed to actuate all the nations of Europe. Her native country
was by no means exempt from similar tendencies, but these evils were
less imminent, and its manners and government, in their present
modifications, were unspeakably more favourable to the dignity and
improvement of the human race than those which prevailed in any part of
the ancient world.

My solicitations and my obligation to repair to England overweighed her
objections, but her new reflections led her to form new determinations
with regard to this part of her property. She concluded to retain
possession, and hoped that some future event would allow her to return
to this favourite spot without forfeiture of my society. An abode of
some years in Europe would more eminently qualify her for the enjoyment
of retirement and safety in her native country. The time that should
elapse before her embarkation, she was desirous of passing among the
shades of this romantic retreat.

I was by no means reconciled to this proceeding. I loved my friend too
well to endure any needless separation without repining. In addition to
this, the image of Ormond haunted my thoughts, and gave birth to
incessant but indefinable fears. I believed that her safety would very
little depend upon the nature of her abode, or the number or
watchfulness of her companions. My nearness to her person would
frustrate no stratagem, nor promote any other end than my own
entanglement in the same fold. Still, that I was not apprized each hour
of her condition, that her state was lonely and sequestered, were
sources of disquiet, the obvious remedy to which was her coming to New
York. Preparations for departure were assigned to me, and these required
my continuance in the city.

Once a week, Laffert, her tenant, visited, for purposes of traffic, the
city. He was the medium of our correspondence. To him I intrusted a
letter, in which my dissatisfaction at her absence, and the causes which
gave it birth, were freely confessed.

The confidence of safety seldom deserted my friend. Since her mysterious
conversation with Ormond, he had utterly vanished. Previous to that
interview, his visits or his letters were incessant and punctual; but
since, no token was given that he existed. Two months had elapsed. He
gave her no reason to expect a cessation of intercourse. He had parted
from her with his usual abruptness and informality. She did not conceive
it incumbent on her to search him out, but she would not have been
displeased with an opportunity to discuss with him more fully the
motives of her conduct. This opportunity had been hitherto denied.

Her occupations in her present retreat were, for the most part, dictated
by caprice or by chance. The mildness of autumn permitted her to ramble,
during the day, from one rock and one grove to another. There was a
luxury in musing, and in the sensations which the scenery and silence
produced, which, in consequence of her long estrangement from them, were
accompanied with all the attractions of novelty, and from which she
would not consent to withdraw.

In the evening she usually retired to the mansion, and shut herself up
in that apartment which, in the original structure of the house, had
been designed for study, and no part of whose furniture had been removed
or displaced. It was a kind of closet on the second floor, illuminated
by a spacious window, through which a landscape of uncommon amplitude
and beauty was presented to the view. Here the pleasures of the day were
revived, by recalling and enumerating them in letters to her friend. She
always quitted this recess with reluctance, and seldom till the night
was half spent.

One evening she retired hither when the sun had just dipped beneath the
horizon. Her implements of writing were prepared; but, before the pen
was assumed, her eyes rested for a moment on the variegated hues which
were poured out upon the western sky and upon the scene of intermingled
waters, copses, and fields. The view comprised a part of the road which
led to this dwelling. It was partially and distantly seen, and the
passage of horses or men was betokened chiefly by the dust which was
raised by their footsteps.

A token of this kind now caught her attention. It fixed her eye chiefly
by the picturesque effect produced by interposing its obscurity between
her and the splendours which the sun had left. Presently she gained a
faint view of a man and horse. This circumstance laid no claim to
attention, and she was withdrawing her eye, when the traveller's
stopping and dismounting at the gate made her renew her scrutiny. This
was reinforced by something in the figure and movements of the horseman
which reminded her of Ormond.

She started from her seat with some degree of palpitation. Whence this
arose, whether from fear or from joy, or from intermixed emotions, it
would not be easy to ascertain. Having entered the gate, the visitant,
remounting his horse, set the animal on full speed. Every moment brought
him nearer, and added to her first belief. He stopped not till he
reached the mansion. The person of Ormond was distinctly recognised.

An interview at this dusky and lonely hour, in circumstances so abrupt
and unexpected, could not fail to surprise, and, in some degree, to
alarm. The substance of his last conversation was recalled. The evils
which were darkly and ambiguously predicted thronged to her memory. It
seemed as if the present moment was to be, in some way, decisive of her
fate. This visit she did not hesitate to suppose designed for her, but
somewhat uncommonly momentous must have prompted him to take so long a
journey.

The rooms on the lower floor were dark, the windows and doors being
fastened. She had entered the house by the principal door, and this was
the only one at present unlocked. The room in which she sat was over the
hall, and the massive door beneath could not be opened without noisy
signals. The question that occurred to her, by what means Ormond would
gain admittance to her presence, she supposed would be instantly
decided. She listened to hear his footsteps on the pavement, or the
creaking of hinges. The silence, however, continued profound as before.

After a minute's pause, she approached the window more nearly and
endeavoured to gain a view of the space before the house. She saw
nothing but the horse, whose bridle was thrown over his neck, and who
was left at liberty to pick up what scanty herbage the lawn afforded to
his hunger. The rider had disappeared.

It now occurred to her that this visit had a purpose different from that
which she at first conjectured. It was easily conceived that Ormond was
unacquainted with her residence at this spot. The knowledge could only
be imparted to him by indirect or illicit means. That these means had
been employed by him, she was by no means authorized to infer from the
silence and distance he had lately maintained. But if an interview with
her were not the purpose of his coming, how should she interpret it?




CHAPTER IX.


While occupied with these reflections, the light hastily disappeared,
and darkness, rendered, by a cloudy atmosphere, uncommonly intense,
succeeded. She had the means of lighting a lamp that hung against the
wall, but had been too much immersed in thought to notice the deepening
of the gloom. Recovering from her reverie, she looked around her with
some degree of trepidation, and prepared to strike a spark that would
enable her to light her lamp.

She had hitherto indulged an habitual indifference to danger. Now the
presence of Ormond, the unknown purpose that led him hither, and the
defencelessness of her condition, inspired her with apprehensions to
which she had hitherto been a stranger. She had been accustomed to pass
many nocturnal hours in this closet. Till now, nothing had occurred that
made her enter it with circumspection or continue in it with reluctance.

Her sensations were no longer tranquil. Each minute that she spent in
this recess appeared to multiply her hazards. To linger here appeared to
her the height of culpable temerity. She hastily resolved to return to
the farmer's dwelling, and, on the morrow, to repair to New York. For
this end she was desirous to produce a light. The materials were at
hand.

She lifted her hand to strike the flint, when her ear caught a sound
which betokened the opening of the door that led into the next
apartment. Her motion was suspended, and she listened as well as a
throbbing heart would permit. That Ormond's was the hand that opened,
was the first suggestion of her fears. The motives of this unseasonable
entrance could not be reconciled with her safety. He had given no
warning of his approach, and the door was opened with tardiness and
seeming caution.

Sounds continued, of which no distinct conception could be obtained, or
the cause that produced them assigned. The floors of every apartment
being composed, like the walls and ceiling, of cement, footsteps were
rendered almost undistinguishable. It was plain, however, that some one
approached her own door.

The panic and confusion that now invaded her was owing to surprise, and
to the singularity of her situation. The mansion was desolate and
lonely. It was night. She was immersed in darkness. She had not the
means, and was unaccustomed to the office, of repelling personal
injuries. What injuries she had reason to dread, who was the agent, and
what were his motives, were subjects Of vague and incoherent meditation.

Meanwhile, low and imperfect sounds, that had in them more of inanimate
than human, assailed her ear. Presently they ceased. An inexplicable
fear deterred her from calling. Light would have exercised a friendly
influence. This it was in her power to produce, but not without motion
and noise; and these, by occasioning the discovery of her being in the
closet, might possibly enhance her danger.

Conceptions like these were unworthy of the mind of Constantia. An
interval of silence succeeded, interrupted only by the whistling of the
blast without. It was sufficient for the restoration of her courage. She
blushed at the cowardice which had trembled at a sound. She considered
that Ormond might, indeed, be near, but that he was probably unconscious
of her situation. His coming was not with the circumspection of an
enemy. He might be acquainted with the place of her retreat, and had
come to obtain an interview, with no clandestine or mysterious purposes.
The noises she had heard had, doubtless, proceeded from the next
apartment, but might be produced by some harmless or vagrant creature.

These considerations restored her tranquillity. They enabled her,
deliberately, to create a light, but they did not dissuade her from
leaving the house. Omens of evil seemed to be connected with this
solitary and darksome abode. Besides, Ormond had unquestionably entered
upon this scene It could not be doubted that she was the object of his
visit. The farm-house was a place of meeting more suitable and safe than
any other. Thither, therefore, she determined immediately to return.

The closet had but one door, and this led into the chamber where the
sounds had arisen. Through this chamber, therefore, she was obliged to
pass, in order to reach the staircase, which terminated in the hall
below.

Bearing the light in her left hand, she withdrew the bolt of the door
and opened. In spite of courageous efforts, she opened with
unwillingness, and shuddered to throw a glance forward or advance a step
into the room. This was not needed, to reveal to her the cause of her
late disturbance. Her eye instantly lighted on the body of a man,
supine, motionless, stretched on the floor, close to the door through
which she was about to pass.

A spectacle like this was qualified to startle her. She shrunk back, and
fixed a more steadfast eye upon the prostrate person. There was no mark
of blood or of wounds, but there was something in the attitude more
significant of death than of sleep. His face rested on the floor, and
his ragged locks concealed what part of his visage was not hidden by his
posture. His garb was characterized by fashionable elegance, but was
polluted with dust.

The image that first occurred to her was that of Ormond. This instantly
gave place to another, which was familiar to her apprehension. It was at
first too indistinctly seen to suggest a name. She continued to gaze and
to be lost in fearful astonishment. Was this the person whose entrance
had been overheard, and who had dragged himself hither to die at her
door? Yet, in that case, would not groans and expiring efforts have
testified his condition and invoked her succour? Was he not brought
hither in the arms of his assassin? She mused upon the possible motives
that induced some one thus to act, and upon the connection that might
subsist between her destiny and that of the dead.

Her meditations, however fruitless in other respects, could not fail to
show her the propriety of hastening from this spot. To scrutinize the
form or face of the dead was a task to which her courage was unequal.
Suitably accompanied and guarded, she would not scruple to return and
ascertain, by the most sedulous examination, the cause of this ominous
event.

She stepped over the breathless corpse, and hurried to the staircase. It
became her to maintain the command of her muscles and joints, and to
proceed without faltering or hesitation. Scarcely had she reached the
entrance of the hall, when, casting anxious looks forward, she beheld a
human figure. No scrutiny was requisite to inform her that this was
Ormond.

She stopped. He approached her with looks and gestures placid but
solemn. There was nothing in his countenance rugged or malignant. On the
contrary, there were tokens of compassion.

"So," said he, "I expected to meet you. Alight, gleaming from the
window, marked you out. This and Laffert's directions have guided me."

"What," said Constantia, with discomposure in her accent, "was your
motive for seeking me?"

"Have you forgotten," said Ormond, "what passed at our last interview?
The evil that I then predicted is at hand. Perhaps you were incredulous;
you accounted me a madman or deceiver; now I am come to witness the
fulfilment of my words and the completion of your destiny. To rescue you
I have not come: that is not within the compass of human powers.

"Poor Constantia," he continued, in tones that manifested genuine
sympathy, "look upon thyself as lost. The toils that beset thee are
inextricable. Summon up thy patience to endure the evil. Now will the
last and heaviest trial betide thy fortitude. I could weep for thee, if
my manly nature would permit. This is the scene of thy calamity, and
this the hour."

These words were adapted to excite curiosity mingled with terror.
Ormond's deportment was of an unexampled tenor, as well as that evil
which he had so ambiguously predicted. He offered no protection from
danger, and yet gave no proof of being himself an agent or auxiliary.
After a minute's pause, Constantia, recovering a firm tone, said,--

"Mr. Ormond, your recent deportment but ill accords with your
professions of sincerity and plain dealing. What your purpose is, or
whether you have any purpose, I am at a loss to conjecture. Whether you
most deserve censure or ridicule, is a point which you afford me not the
means of deciding, and to which, unless on your own account, I am
indifferent. If you are willing to be more explicit, or if there be any
topic on which you wish further to converse, I will not refuse your
company to Laffert's dwelling. Longer to remain here would be indiscreet
and absurd."

So saying, she motioned towards the door. Ormond was passive, and seemed
indisposed to prevent her departure, till she laid her hand upon the
lock. He then, without moving from his place, exclaimed,--

"Stay! Must this meeting, which fate ordains to be the last, be so
short? Must a time and place so suitable for what remains to be said and
done be neglected or misused? No. You charge me with duplicity, and deem
my conduct either ridiculous or criminal. I have stated my reasons for
concealment, but these have failed to convince you. Well, here is now an
end to doubt. All ambiguities are preparing to vanish."

When Ormond began to speak, Constantia paused to hearken to him. His
vehemence was not of that nature which threatened to obstruct her
passage. It was by entreaty that he apparently endeavoured to detain her
steps, and not by violence. Hence arose her patience to listen. He
continued:--

"Constantia! thy father is dead. Art thou not desirous of detecting the
author of his fate? Will it afford thee no consolation to know that the
deed is punished? Wilt thou suffer me to drag the murderer to thy feet?
Thy justice will be gratified by this sacrifice. Somewhat will be due to
him who avenged thy wrong in the blood of the perpetrator. What sayest
thou? Grant me thy permission, and in a moment I will drag him hither."

These words called up the image of the person whose corpse she had
lately seen. It was readily conceived that to him Ormond alluded; but
this was the assassin of her father, and his crime had been detected and
punished by Ormond! These images had no other effect than to urge her
departure: she again applied her hand to the lock, and said,--

"This scene must not be prolonged. My father's death I desire not to
hear explained or to see revenged, but whatever information you are
willing or able to communicate must be deferred."

"Nay," interrupted Ormond, with augmented vehemence, "art thou equally
devoid of curiosity and justice? Thinkest thou that the enmity which
bereft thy father of life will not seek thy own? There are evils which I
cannot prevent thee from enduring, but there are, likewise, ills which
my counsel will enable thee and thy friend to shun. Save me from
witnessing thy death. Thy father's destiny is sealed; all that remained
was to punish his assassin; but thou and thy Sophia still live. Why
should ye perish by a like stroke?"

This intimation was sufficient to arrest the steps of Constantia. She
withdrew her hand from the door, and fixed eyes of the deepest anxiety
on Ormond:--"What mean you? How am I to understand--"

"Ah!" said Ormond, "I see thou wilt consent to stay. Thy detention shall
not be long. Remain where thou art during one moment,--merely while I
drag hither thy enemy and show thee a visage which thou wilt not be slow
to recognise." Saying this, he hastily ascended the staircase, and
quickly passed beyond her sight.

Deportment thus mysterious could not fail of bewildering her thoughts.
There was somewhat in the looks and accents of Ormond, different from
former appearances; tokens of a hidden purpose and a smothered meaning
were perceptible,--a mixture of the inoffensive and the lawless, which,
added to the loneliness and silence that encompassed her, produced a
faltering emotion. Her curiosity was overpowered by her fear, and the
resolution was suddenly conceived of seizing this opportunity to escape.

A third time she put her hand to the lock and attempted to open. The
effort was ineffectual. The door that was accustomed to obey the
gentlest touch was now immovable. She had lately unlocked and passed
through it. Her eager inspection convinced her that the principal bolt
was still withdrawn, but a small one was now perceived, of whose
existence she had not been apprized, and over which her key had no
power.

Now did she first harbour a fear that was intelligible in its dictates.
Now did she first perceive herself sinking in the toils of some lurking
enemy. Hope whispered that this foe was not Ormond. His conduct had
bespoken no willingness to put constraint upon her steps. He talked not
as if he was aware of this obstruction, and yet his seeming acquiescence
might have flowed from a knowledge that she had no power to remove
beyond his reach.

He warned her of danger to her life, of which he was her self-appointed
rescuer. His counsel was to arm her with sufficient caution; the peril
that awaited her was imminent; this was the time and place of its
occurrence, and here she was compelled to remain, till the power that
fastened would condescend to loose the door. There were other avenues to
the hall. These were accustomed to be locked; but Ormond had found
access, and, if all continued fast, it was incontestable that he was the
author of this new impediment.

The other avenues were hastily examined. All were bolted and locked. The
first impulse led her to call for help from without; but the mansion was
distant from Laffert's habitation. This spot was wholly unfrequented. No
passenger was likely to be stationed where her call could be heard.
Besides, this forcible detention might operate for a short time, and be
attended with no mischievous consequences. Whatever was to come, it was
her duty to collect her courage and encounter it.

Tho steps of Ormond above now gave tokens of his approach. Vigilant
observance of this man was all that her situation permitted. A vehement
effort restored her to some degree of composure. Her stifled
palpitations allowed her steadfastly to notice him as he now descended
the stairs, bearing a lifeless body in his arms. "There!" said he, as he
cast it at her feet; "whose countenance is that? Who would imagine that
features like those belonged to an assassin and impostor?"

Closed eyelids and fallen muscles could not hide from her lineaments so
often seen. She shrunk back and exclaimed, "Thomas Craig!"

A pause succeeded, in which she alternately gazed at the countenance of
this unfortunate wretch and at Ormond. At length, the latter
exclaimed,--

"Well, my girl, hast thou examined him? Dost thou recognise a friend or
an enemy?"

"I know him well: but how came this? What purpose brought him hither?
Who was the author of his fate?"

"Have I not already told thee that Ormond was his own avenger and thine?
To thee and to me he has been a robber. To him thy father is indebted
for the loss not only of property but life. Did crimes like these merit
a less punishment? And what recompense is due to him whose vigilance
pursued him hither and made him pay for his offences with his blood?
What benefit have I received at thy hand to authorize me, for thy sake,
to take away his life?"

"No benefit received from me," said Constantia, "would justify such an
act. I should have abhorred myself for annexing to my benefits so bloody
a condition. It calls for no gratitude or recompense. Its suitable
attendant is remorse. That he is a thief, I know but too well; that my
father died by his hand is incredible. No motives or means--"

"Why so?" interrupted Ormond. "Does not sleep seal up the senses? Cannot
closets be unlocked at midnight? Cannot adjoining houses communicate by
doors? Cannot these doors be hidden from suspicion by a sheet of
canvas?"

These words were of startling and abundant import. They reminded her of
circumstances in her father's chamber, which sufficiently explained the
means by which his life was assailed. The closet, and its canvas-covered
wall; the adjoining house untenanted and shut up--but this house, though
unoccupied, belonged to Ormond. From the inferences which flowed hence,
her attention was withdrawn by her companion, who continued:--

"Do these means imply the interposal of a miracle? His motives? What
scruples can be expected from a man inured from infancy to cunning and
pillage? Will he abstain from murder when urged by excruciating poverty,
by menaces of persecution, by terror of expiring on the gallows?"

Tumultuous suspicions were now awakened in the mind of Constantia. Her
faltering voice scarcely allowed her to ask, "How know _you_ that Craig
was thus guilty?--that these were his incitements and means?"

Ormond's solemnity now gave place to a tone of sarcasm and looks of
exultation:--"Poor Constantia! Thou art still pestered with incredulity
and doubts! My veracity is still in question! My knowledge, girl, is
infallible. That these were his means of access I cannot be ignorant,
for I pointed them out. He was urged by these motives, for they were
stated and enforced by me. His was the deed, for I stood beside him when
it was done."

These, indeed, were terms that stood in no need of further explanation.
The veil that shrouded this formidable being was lifted high enough to
make him be regarded with inexplicable horror. What his future acts
should be, how his omens of ill were to be solved, were still involved
in uncertainty.

In the midst of fears for her own safety, by which Constantia was now
assailed, the image of her father was revived; keen regret and vehement
upbraiding were conjured up.

"Craig, then, was the instrument, and yours the instigation, that
destroyed my father! In what had he offended you? What cause had he
given for resentment?"

"Cause!" replied he, with impetuous accents. "Resentment! None. My
motive was benevolent; my deed conferred a benefit. I gave him sight and
took away his life, from motives equally wise. Know you not that Ormond
was fool enough to set value on the affections of a woman? These were
sought with preposterous anxiety and endless labour. Among other
facilitators of his purpose, he summoned gratitude to his aid. To
snatch you from poverty, to restore his sight to your father, were
expected to operate as incentives to love.

"But here I was the dupe of error. A thousand prejudices stood in my
way. These, provided our intercourse were not obstructed, I hoped to
subdue. The rage of innovation seized your father: this, blended with a
mortal antipathy to me, made him labour to seduce you from the bosom of
your peaceful country; to make you enter on a boisterous sea; to visit
lands where all is havoc and hostility; to snatch you from the influence
of my arguments.

"This new obstacle I was bound to remove. While revolving the means,
chance and his evil destiny threw Craig in my way. I soon convinced him
that his reputation and his life were in my hands. His retention of
these depended upon my will, on the performance of conditions which I
prescribed.

"My happiness and yours depended on your concurrence with my wishes.
Your father's life was an obstacle to your concurrence. For killing him,
therefore, I may claim your gratitude. His death was a due and
disinterested offering at the altar of your felicity and mine.

"My deed was not injurious to him. At his age, death, whose coming at
some period is inevitable, could not be distant. To make it unforeseen
and brief, and void of pain,--to preclude the torments of a lingering
malady, a slow and visible descent to the grave,--was the dictate of
beneficence. But of what value was a continuance of his life? Either you
would have gone with him to Europe or have stayed at home with me. In
the first case, his life would have been rapidly consumed by perils and
cares. In the second, separation from you, and union with me,--a being
so detestable,--would equally have poisoned his existence.

"Craig's cowardice and crimes made him a pliant and commodious tool. I
pointed out the way. The unsuspected door which led into the closet of
your father's chamber was made, by my direction, during the life of
Helena. By this avenue I was wont to post myself where all your
conversations could be overheard. By this avenue an entrance and
retreat were afforded to the agent of my newest purpose.

"Fool that I was! I solaced myself with the belief that all impediments
were now smoothed, when a new enemy appeared. My folly lasted as long as
my hope. I saw that to gain your affections, fortified by antiquated
scruples and obsequious to the guidance of this new monitor, was
impossible. It is not my way to toil after that which is beyond my
reach. If the greater good be inaccessible, I learn to be contented with
the less.

"I have served you with successless sedulity. I have set an engine in
act to obliterate an obstacle to your felicity, and lay your father at
rest. Under my guidance, this engine was productive only of good.
Governed by itself or by another, it will only work you harm. I have,
therefore, hastened to destroy it. Lo! it is now before you motionless
and impotent.

"For this complexity of benefit I look for no reward. I am not tired of
well-doing. Having ceased to labour for an unattainable good, I have
come hither to possess myself of all that I now crave, and by the same
deed to afford you an illustrious opportunity to signalize your wisdom
and your fortitude."

During this speech, the mind of Constantia became more deeply pervaded
with dread of some overhanging but incomprehensible evil. The strongest
impulse was to gain a safe asylum, at a distance from this spot and from
the presence of this extraordinary being. This impulse was followed by
the recollection that her liberty was taken away, that egress from the
hall was denied her, and that this restriction might be part of some
conspiracy of Ormond against her life.

Security from danger like this would be, in the first place, sought, by
one of Constantia's sex and opinions, in flight. This had been rendered,
by some fatal chance or by the precautions of her foe, impracticable.
Stratagem or force was all that remained to elude or disarm her
adversary. For the contrivance and execution of fraud, all the habits of
her life and all the maxims of her education had conspired to unfit her.
Her force of muscles would avail her nothing against the superior
energy of Ormond.

She remembered that to inflict death was no iniquitous exertion of
self-defence, and that the penknife which she held in her hand was
capable of this service. She had used it to remove any lurking
obstruction in the wards of her key, supposing, for a time, this to be
the cause of her failing to withdraw the bolt of the door. This resource
was, indeed, scarcely less disastrous and deplorable than any fate from
which it could rescue her. Some uncertainty still involved the
intentions of Ormond. As soon as he paused, she spoke:--

"How am I to understand this prelude? Let me know the full extent of my
danger,--why it is that I am hindered from leaving this house, and why
this interview was sought."

"Ah, Constantia, this, indeed, is merely a prelude to a scene that is to
terminate my influence over thy fate. When this is past I have sworn to
part with thee forever. Art thou still dubious of my purpose? Art thou
not a woman? And have I not entreated for thy love and been rejected?

"Canst thou imagine that I aim at thy life? My avowals of love were
sincere; my passion was vehement and undisguised. It gave dignity and
value to a gift in thy power, as a woman, to bestow. This has been
denied. That gift has lost none of its value in my eyes. What thou
refusest to bestow it is in my power to extort. I came for that end.
When this end is accomplished, I will restore thee to liberty."

These words were accompanied by looks that rendered all explanation of
their meaning useless. The evil reserved for her, hitherto obscured by
half-disclosed and contradictory attributes, was now sufficiently
apparent. The truth in this respect unveiled itself with the rapidity
and brightness of an electrical flash.

She was silent. She cast her eyes at the windows and doors. Escape
through them was hopeless. She looked at those lineaments of Ormond
which evinced his disdain of supplication and inexorable passions. She
felt that entreaty and argument would be vain; that all appeals to his
compassion and benevolence would counteract her purpose, since, in the
unexampled conformation of this man's mind, these principles were made
subservient to his most flagitious designs. Considerations of justice
and pity were made, by a fatal perverseness of reasoning, champions and
bulwarks of his most atrocious mistakes.

The last extremes of opposition, the most violent expedients for
defence, would be justified by being indispensable. To find safety for
her honour, even in the blood of an assailant, was the prescription of
duty. Tho equity of this species of defence was not, in the present
confusion of her mind, a subject of momentary doubt.

To forewarn him of her desperate purpose would be to furnish him with
means of counteraction. Her weapon would easily be wrested from her
feeble hand. Ineffectual opposition would only precipitate her evil
destiny. A rage, contented with nothing less than her life, might be
awakened in his bosom. But was not this to be desired? Death, untimely
and violent, was better than the loss of honour.

This thought led to a new series of reflections. She involuntarily
shrunk from the act of killing: but would her efforts to destroy her
adversary be effectual? Would not his strength and dexterity easily
repel or elude them? Her power in this respect was questionable, but her
power was undeniably sufficient to a different end. The instrument which
could not rescue her from this injury by the destruction of another
might save her from it by her own destruction.

These thoughts rapidly occurred; but the resolution to which they led
was scarcely formed, when Ormond advanced towards her. She recoiled a
few steps, and, showing the knife which she held, said,--

"Ormond! Beware! Know that my unalterable resolution is to die
uninjured. I have the means in my power. Stop where you are; one step
more, and I plunge this knife into my heart. I know that to contend with
your strength or your reason would be vain. To turn this weapon against
you I should not fear, if I were sure of success; but to that I will
not trust. To save a greater good by the sacrifice of life is in my
power, and that sacrifice shall be made."

"Poor Constantia!" replied Ormond, in a tone of contempt; "so thou
preferrest thy imaginary honour to life! To escape this injury without a
name or substance, without connection with the past or future, without
contamination of thy purity or thraldom of thy will, thou wilt kill
thyself; put an end to thy activity in virtue's cause; rob thy friend of
her solace, the world of thy beneficence, thyself of being and pleasure?

"I shall be grieved for the fatal issue of my experiment; I shall mourn
over thy martyrdom to the most opprobrious and contemptible of all
errors: but that thou shouldst undergo the trial is decreed. There is
still an interval of hope that thy cowardice is counterfeited, or that
it will give place to wisdom and courage.

"Whatever thou intendest by way of prevention or cure, it behooves thee
to employ with steadfastness. Die with the guilt of suicide and the
brand of cowardice upon thy memory, or live with thy claims to felicity
and approbation undiminished. Choose which thou wilt. Thy decision is of
moment to thyself, but of none to me. Living or dead, the prize that I
have in view shall be mine."




CHAPTER X.


It will be requisite to withdraw your attention from this scene for a
moment, and fix it on myself. My impatience of my friend's delay, for
some days preceding this disastrous interview, became continually more
painful. As the time of our departure approached, my dread of some
misfortune or impediment increased. Ormond's disappearance from the
scene contributed but little to my consolation. To wrap his purposes in
mystery, to place himself at seeming distance, was the usual artifice of
such as he,--was necessary to the maturing of his project and the
hopeless entanglement of his victim. I saw no means of placing the
safety of my friend beyond his reach. Between different methods of
procedure, there was, however, room for choice. Her present abode was
more hazardous than an abode in the city. To be alone argued a state
more defenceless and perilous than to be attended by me.

I wrote her an urgent admonition to return. My remonstrances were
couched in such terms as, in my own opinion, laid her under the
necessity of immediate compliance. The letter was despatched by the
usual messenger, and for some hours I solaced myself with the prospect
of a speedy meeting.

These thoughts gave place to doubt and apprehension. I began to distrust
the efficacy of my arguments, and to invent a thousand reasons, inducing
her, in defiance of my rhetoric, at least to protract her absence. These
reasons I had not previously conceived, and had not, therefore,
attempted, in my letter, to invalidate their force. This omission was
possible to be supplied in a second epistle; but, meanwhile, time would
be lost, and my new arguments might, like the old, fail to convince
her. At least, the tongue was a much more versatile and powerful
advocate than the pen; and, by hastening to her habitation, I might
either compel her to return with me, or ward off danger by my presence,
or share it with her. I finally resolved to join her by the speediest
conveyance.

This resolution was suggested by the meditations of a sleepless night. I
rose with the dawn, and sought out the means of transporting myself,
with most celerity, to the abode of my friend. A stage-boat, accustomed
twice a day to cross New York Bay to Staten Island, was prevailed upon,
by liberal offers, to set out upon the voyage at the dawn of day. The
sky was gloomy, and the air boisterous and unsettled. The wind, suddenly
becoming tempestuous and adverse, rendered the voyage at once tedious
and full of peril. A voyage of nine miles was not effected in less than
eight hours and without imminent and hairbreadth danger of being
drowned.

Fifteen miles of the journey remained to be performed by land. A
carriage, with the utmost difficulty, was procured, but lank horses and
a crazy vehicle were but little in unison with my impatience. We reached
not Amboy ferry till some hours after nightfall. I was rowed across the
Sound, and proceeded to accomplish the remainder of my journey--about
three miles--on foot.

I was actuated to this speed by indefinite but powerful motives. The
belief that my speedy arrival was essential to the rescue of my friend
from some inexplicable injury haunted me with ceaseless importunity. On
no account would I have consented to postpone this precipitate
expedition till the morrow.

I at length arrived at Dudley's farm-house. The inhabitants were struck
with wonder at the sight of me. My clothes were stained by the water by
which every passenger was copiously sprinkled during our boisterous
navigation, and soiled by dust; my frame was almost overpowered by
fatigue and abstinence.

To my anxious inquiries respecting my friend, they told me that her
evenings were usually spent at the mansion, where it was probable she
was now to be found. They were not apprized of any inconvenience or
danger that betided her. It was her custom sometimes to prolong her
absence till midnight.

I could not applaud the discretion nor censure the temerity of this
proceeding. My mind was harassed by unintelligible omens and
self-confuted fears. To obviate the danger and to banish my inquietudes
was my first duty. For this end I hastened to the mansion. Having passed
the intervening hillocks and copses, I gained a view of the front of the
building. My heart suddenly sunk, on observing that no apartment--not
even that in which I knew it was her custom to sit at these unseasonable
hours--was illuminated. A gleam from the window of the study I should
have regarded as an argument at once of her presence and her safety.

I approached the house with misgiving and faltering steps. The gate
leading into a spacious court was open. A sound on one side attracted my
attention. In the present state of my thoughts, any near or unexplained
sound sufficed to startle me. Looking towards the quarter whence my
panic was excited, I espied, through the dusk, a horse grazing, with his
bridle thrown over his neck.

This appearance was a new source of perplexity and alarm. The inference
was unavoidable that a visitant was here. Who that visitant was, and how
he was now employed, was a subject of eager but fruitless curiosity.
Within and around the mansion, all was buried in the deepest repose. I
now approached the principal door, and, looking through the keyhole,
perceived a lamp, standing on the lowest step of the staircase. It shed
a pale light over the lofty ceiling and marble balustrades. No face or
movement of a human being was perceptible.

These tokens assured me that some one was within: they also accounted
for the non-appearance of light at the window above. I withdrew my eye
from this avenue, and was preparing to knock loudly for admission, when
my attention was awakened by some one who advanced to the door from the
inside and seemed busily engaged in unlocking. I started back and waited
with impatience till the door should open and the person issue forth.

Presently I heard a voice within exclaim, in accents of mingled terror
and grief, "Oh, what--what will become of me? Shall I never be released
from this detested prison?"

The voice was that of Constantia. It penetrated to my heart like an
icebolt. I once more darted a glance through the crevice. A figure, with
difficulty recognised to be that of my friend, now appeared in sight.
Her hands were clasped on her breast, her eyes wildly fixed upon the
ceiling and streaming with tears, and her hair unbound and falling
confusedly over her bosom and neck.

My sensations scarcely permitted me to call, "Constantia! For Heaven's
sake, what has happened to you? Open the door, I beseech you."

"What voice is that? Sophia Courtland! O my friend! I am imprisoned!
Some demon has barred the door, beyond my power to unfasten. Ah, why
comest thou so late? Thy succour would have somewhat profited if sooner
given; but now, the lost Constantia--" Here her voice sunk into
convulsive sobs.

In the midst of my own despair, on perceiving the fulfilment of my
apprehensions, and what I regarded as the fatal execution of some
project of Ormond, I was not insensible to the suggestions of prudence.
I entreated my friend to retain her courage, while I flew to Laffert's
and returned with suitable assistance to burst open the door.

The people of the farm-house readily obeyed my summons. Accompanied by
three men of powerful sinews, sons and servants of the farmer, I
returned with the utmost expedition to the mansion. The lamp still
remained in its former place, but our loudest calls were unanswered. The
silence was uninterrupted and profound.

The door yielded to strenuous and repeated efforts, and I rushed into
the hall. The first object that met my sight was my friend, stretched
upon the floor, pale and motionless, supine, and with all the tokens of
death.

From this object my attention was speedily attracted by two figures,
breathless and supine like that of Constantia. One of them was Ormond. A
smile of disdain still sat upon his features. The wound by which he fell
was secret, and was scarcely betrayed by the effusion of a drop of
blood. The face of the third victim was familiar to my early days. It
was that of the impostor whose artifice had torn from Mr. Dudley his
peace and fortune.

An explication of this scene was hopeless. By what disastrous and
inscrutable fate a place like this became the scene of such complicated
havoc, to whom Craig was indebted for his death, what evil had been
meditated or inflicted by Ormond, and by what means his project had
arrived at this bloody consummation, were topics of wild and fearful
conjecture.

But my friend--the first impulse of my fears was to regard her as dead.
Hope and a closer observation outrooted, or, at least, suspended, this
opinion. One of the men lifted her in his arms. No trace of blood or
mark of fatal violence was discoverable, and the effusion of cold water
restored her, though slowly, to life.

To withdraw her from this spectacle of death was my first care. She
suffered herself to be led to the farm-house. She was carried to her
chamber. For a time she appeared incapable of recollection. She grasped
my hand, as I sat by her bedside, but scarcely gave any other tokens of
life.

From this state of inactivity she gradually recovered. I was actuated by
a thousand forebodings, but refrained from molesting her by
interrogation or condolence. I watched by her side in silence, but was
eager to collect from her own lips an account of this mysterious
transaction.

At length she opened her eyes, and appeared to recollect her present
situation, and the events which led to it. I inquired into her
condition, and asked if there were any thing in my power to procure or
perform for her.

"Oh, my friend," she answered, "what have I done, what have I suffered,
within the last dreadful hour! The remembrance, though insupportable,
will never leave me. You can do nothing for my relief. All I claim is
your compassion and your sympathy."

"I hope," said I, "that nothing has happened to load you with guilt or
with shame?"

"Alas! I know not. My deed was scarcely the fruit of intention. It was
suggested by a momentary frenzy. I saw no other means of escaping from
vileness and pollution. I was menaced with an evil worse than death. I
forebore till my strength was almost subdued: the lapse of another
moment would have placed me beyond hope.

"My stroke was desperate and at random. It answered my purpose too well.
He cast at me a look of terrible upbraiding, but spoke not. His heart
was pierced, and he sunk, as if struck by lightning, at my feet. O much
erring and unhappy Ormond! That thou shouldst thus untimely perish! That
I should be thy executioner!"

These words sufficiently explained the scene that I had witnessed. The
violence of Ormond had been repulsed by equal violence. His foul
attempts had been prevented by his death. Not to deplore the necessity
which had produced this act was impossible; but, since this necessity
existed, it was surely not a deed to be thought upon with lasting
horror, or to be allowed to generate remorse.

In consequence of this catastrophe, arduous duties had devolved upon me.
The people that surrounded me were powerless with terror. Their
ignorance and cowardice left them at a loss how to act in this
emergency. They besought my direction, and willingly performed whatever
I thought proper to enjoin upon them.

No deliberation was necessary to acquaint me with my duty. Laffert was
despatched to the nearest magistrate with a letter, in which his
immediate presence was entreated and these transactions were briefly
explained. Early the next day the formalities of justice, in the
inspection of the bodies and the examination of witnesses, were
executed. It would be needless to dwell on the particulars of this
catastrophe. A sufficient explanation has been given of the causes that
led to it. They were such as exempted my friend from legal
animadversion. Her act was prompted by motives which every scheme of
jurisprudence known in the world not only exculpates, but applauds. To
state these motives before a tribunal hastily formed and exercising its
functions on the spot was a task not to be avoided, though infinitely
painful. Remonstrances the most urgent and pathetic could scarcely
conquer her reluctance.

This task, however, was easy, in comparison with that which remained. To
restore health and equanimity to my friend; to repel the erroneous
accusations of her conscience; to hinder her from musing, with eternal
anguish, upon this catastrophe; to lay the spirit of secret upbraiding
by which she was incessantly tormented, which bereft her of repose,
empoisoned all her enjoyments, and menaced not only the subversion of
her peace but the speedy destruction of her life, became my next
employment.

My counsels and remonstrances were not wholly inefficacious. They
afforded me the prospect of her ultimate restoration to tranquillity.
Meanwhile, I called to my aid the influence of time and of a change of
scene. I hastened to embark with her for Europe. Our voyage was
tempestuous and dangerous, but storms and perils at length gave way to
security and repose.

Before our voyage was commenced, I endeavoured to procure tidings of the
true condition and designs of Ormond. My information extended no further
than that he had put his American property into the hands of Mr.
Melbourne, and was preparing to embark for France. Courtland, who has
since been at Paris, and who, while there, became confidentially
acquainted with Martinette de Beauvais, has communicated facts of an
unexpected nature.

At the period of Ormond's return to Philadelphia, at which his last
interview with Constantia in that city took place, he visited
Martinette. He avowed himself to be her brother, and supported his
pretensions by relating the incidents of his early life. A separation at
the age of fifteen, and which had lasted for the same number of years,
may be supposed to have considerably changed the countenance and figure
she had formerly known. His relationship was chiefly proved by the
enumeration of incidents of which her brother only could be apprized.

He possessed a minute acquaintance with her own adventures, but
concealed from her the means by which he had procured the knowledge. He
had rarely and imperfectly alluded to his own opinions and xs, and
had maintained an invariable silence on the subject of his connection
with Constantia and Helena. Being informed of her intention to return to
France, he readily complied with her request to accompany her in this
voyage. His intentions in this respect were frustrated by the dreadful
catastrophe that has been just related. Respecting this event,
Martinette had collected only vague and perplexing information.
Courtland, though able to remove her doubts, thought proper to withhold
from her the knowledge he possessed.

Since her arrival in England, the life of my friend has experienced
little variation. Of her personal deportment and domestic habits you
have been a witness. These, therefore, it would be needless for me to
exhibit. It is sufficient to have related events which the recentness of
your intercourse with her hindered you from knowing but by means of some
formal narrative like the present. She and her friend only were able to
impart to you the knowledge which you have so anxiously sought. In
consideration of your merits and of your attachment to my friend, I have
consented to devote my leisure to this task.

It is now finished; and I have only to add my wishes that the perusal of
this tale may afford you as much instruction as the contemplation of the
sufferings and vicissitudes of Constantia Dudley has afforded to me.
Farewell.

THE END.
